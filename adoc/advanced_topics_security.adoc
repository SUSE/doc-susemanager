== Setup a Minion to Master Validation Fingerprint
// ianew: installation/security.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-02-28

In highly secure network configurations you may wish to ensure your minions are connecting a specific master.
To setup validation from minion to master enter the masters fingerprint within the [path]``/etc/salt/minion`` configuration file.
See the following procedure:

. On the master enter the following command as root and note the fingerprint:
+

----
salt-key -F master
----
+

On your minion, open the minion configuration file located in [path]``/etc/salt/minion``.
Uncomment the following line and enter the masters fingerprint replacing the example fingerprint:
+

----
master_finger: 'ba:30:65:2a:d6:9e:20:4f:d8:b2:f3:a7:d4:65:11:13'
----

. Restart the salt-minion service:
+

----
# systemctl restart salt-minion
----

== Signing Repository Metadata
// ianew: installation/security.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-02-28

=== Generate a Custom GPG key

To sign repository metadata a custom GPG key is required. Create a new GPG key as *root* via the following steps.

----
$> gpg --gen-key

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048)
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: company sign key
Email address: company@example.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "company sign key <company@example.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

=== Configure signing metadata
// ianew: installation/security.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-02-28

To enable or disble metadata signing use the `mgr-sign-metadata-ctl` tool:

Usage: mgr-sign-metadata-ctl [enable <keyid> | disable | check-config |
check-channels]
  enable KEYID     Enable GPG signing of repository metadata using the
provided KEYID.
                   Requires a valid key with the given KEYID to exist in
the default keyring.
  disable          Disable GPG signing of repository metadata.
  check-channels   Check if the cached channels repodata is signed.
  check-config     Check configuration and report any problems. This is
the default option.
  regen-metadata   Restart services and schedule metadata regeneration.

In order to enable the GPG signing of the SUSE Manager repository
metadata the user must have a GPG key and the keyring must have a password set.

After the key is generated the password of the keyring must be set in
`/etc/rhn/signing.conf`:

----
GPGPASS="<my sercret pass>"
----

Then list the key ids in short format:

----
gpg --keyid-format short --list-keys
----

This will produce an output similar to this:

----
pub   rsa2048/4E2C3DD8 2019-02-26 [SC] [expires: 2021-02-25]
      6213EBE2292F878CC15DE308F88942134E2C3DD8
uid         [ultimate] SUMA Server <root@localhost>
sub   rsa2048/5B46F2C5 2019-02-26 [E] [expires: 2021-02-25
----

Finaly enable the GPG signing with:

----
mgr-sign-metadata-ctl enable 4E2C3DD8
----

The output should be similar to:

----
OK. Found key 4E2C3DD8 in keyring.
DONE. Set key 4E2C3DD8 in /etc/rhn/signing.conf.
DONE. Enabled metadata signing in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf.
DONE. Exported key 4E2C3DD8 to /srv/susemanager/salt/gpg/mgr-keyring.gpg.
DONE. Exported key 4E2C3DD8 to /srv/www/htdocs/pub/mgr-gpg-pub.key.
----

NOTE. For the changes to become effective run:

----
   mgr-sign-metadata-ctl regen-metadata
----

To regenerate the channel metadata with signing enabled:

----
   mgr-sign-metadata-ctl regen-metadata
----

Note that repo metadata signing is a global option. It affects all
software channels present on the server.

=== Trust the GPG key on all clients
// ianew: installation/security.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-02-28

When this feature is enabled, all clients have to trust the new GPG key.
If the new GPG key is not imported on the client, installation or updating of packages is not possible.

. Import the GPG key on all clients
+

On RPM based systems this can be done using a remote command on all clients
+

----
# rpm --import http://<server.domain.top/pub/keyname.key
$> rpm --import http://suma-refhead-srv.mgr.suse.de/pub/company.key
----
+
For Ubuntu minions reassign the channels. This will take care of adding

the GPG key to the minion.

[TIP]
.Tip
====
For salt managed systems it might make sense to use a state to trust GPG keys.
