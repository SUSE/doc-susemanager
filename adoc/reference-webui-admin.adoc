The menu:Main Menu[Admin] pages allows {productname} customers to manage the basic configuration, including creating and managing multiple organizations.
Only the {productname} administrator can access the menu:Main Menu[Admin] pages.


[[ref.webui.admin.wizard]]
== menu:Main Menu[Admin > Setup Wizard]

Setting up {productname} typically requires some extra steps after installation for common configuration tasks.

The menu:Main Menu[Admin > Setup Wizard] link is displayed when the {productname} {webui} is used for the fist time and can be accessed later at any time by clicking menu:Main Menu[Admin > Setup Wizard].
On the three tabs configure the HTTP proxy server, organization credentials, and {suse} products.

menu:HTTP Proxy:[]::
If needed configure a proxy server that {productname} will use to access SCC ({suse} Customer Center) and other remote servers here.
Use `hostname:port` syntax in the menu:HTTP Proxy[HTTP Proxy Hostname:] field if the proxy port is not 8080.
Clearing the fields disables proxy.
+

image::admin_proxy_settings.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+

menu:Organization Credentials:[]::
Select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Organization Credentials > Add a new credential] then enter user name and password to give another organization/user access to {scc}.
+

image::admin_organization_credentials.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+

After saving, a new credential card will be displayed.
Buttons below the credential card allow you to:

* Check credential validation status (green tick or red cross icon).
To re-check the credential with SCC, click the icon.
* Set the primary credentials for inter-server synchronization (yellow star icon).
* List the subscriptions related to a certain credential (list icon).
* Edit the credential (pencil icon).
* Delete the credential (trash can icon).



[[vle.webui.admin.wizard.products]]
menu:Main Menu[Admin > SUSE Products]::
On the menu:Main Menu[Admin > SUSE Products] page, select product-specific channels you are entitled to.
+

image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+

The products displayed are directly linked to your organization credentials and your {suse} subscriptions.
Product extension and module lists are shown when you click the btn:[arrow] to the left of the product description.
This is a cascading mechanism and allows to unfold several levels according to the integration of the extensions and modules in the base product.
+

Products based on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 or higher have a toggle button named btn:[include recommended].
When the toogle button is enabled on a base product, recommended extensions and modules are automatically selected for synchronization.
Once the btn:[include recommended] button is enabled, you may uncheck product child channels you are not interested in syncing.
Recommended channels are labeled accordingly.
You cannot disable required channels.
+

If you click the menu:Channels[] icon in a row of a product, a popup lists the underlying channels (repositories) that build the product.
+

In the row above the product listing two filter options are available:

* Search by the product description. The filter limits the search to base products.
* Filter by architecture.
Click in the search field (or press kbd:[Enter] ) and then select from drop-down menu.
You can repeat this as often as necessary.
To remove an architecture either click the "`x`" symbol (or press kbd:[Backspace] ).
+

Once you have made your selection(s), click btn:[Add products] in the upper right area.
This is equivalent to running [command]``mgr-sync add products`` or [command]``mgr-sync`` without any arguments.
+

View the synchronization progress in the status bar field to the right.
+

[NOTE]
.Synchronization Time
====
Channel synchronization will start and might take several hours.
When finished the corresponding channels can be used in {productname}.
====
+

[IMPORTANT]
.If Synchronization Fails
====
SUSE does not automatically trust 3rd party GPG keys.
If a reposync fails check if an untrusted GPG key is the cause by viewing the log files located in:

----
/var/log/rhn/reposync
----

Look for lines similar to the following:

----
['/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync', '--channel', 'sle-12-sp1-ga-desktop-
nvidia-driver-x86_64', '--type', 'yum', '--non-interactive']
ChannelException: The GPG key for this repository is not part of the keyring.
Please run spacewalk-repo-sync in interactive mode to import it.
----
====
+

Alternatively, you can add listed channels immediately by clicking the btn:[Add this product] button in the status column.
A progress bar will be displayed.
The main product will expand, and then you may select add-on products belonging to the product that is currently added.
To overview required channels, select the list icon in the menu:SUSE Products[Channels] column.
Once a product has finished downloading, the status bar state will change from a filled percentage value to menu:SUSE Products[Finished].



[[ref.webui.admin.org]]
== menu:Main Menu[Admin > Organizations]

The organizations feature allows {productname} administrators to create and manage multiple organizations across {productname}.
Administrators can control an organization's access to system management tasks.

image::admin_list_organizations.png[scaledwidth=80%]

If you click the name of an organization, the Organization Details page appears.



[[s2-sattools-org-details-details]]
=== menu:Organizations[Organization Details]

The menu:Organization[Organization Details] page lists the details of the selected organization.

image::admin_organization_details.png[scaledwidth=80%]

The following details are available:

* menu:Organization Details[Organization Name] : String (between 3 and 128 characters).
This is the only value that you can change here.
When done, confirm with clicking the btn:[Update Organization] button.
* menu:Organization Details[Organization ID] : Number
* menu:Organization Details[Active Users] : Number.
Clicking this number will open the menu:Organization Details[Users] tab.
* menu:Organization Details[Systems] : Number
* menu:Organization Details[System Groups] : Number
* menu:Organization Details[Activation Keys] : Number
* menu:Organization Details[Autoinstallation Profiles] : Number
* menu:Organization Details[Configuration Channels] : Number



[[s2-sattools-org-details-users]]
=== menu:Organization Details[Users]

List of all the users of an organization.

image::admin_organization_users.png[scaledwidth=80%]

You can modify the user details if you belong to that organization and have organization administrator privileges.



[[s2-sattools-org-details-trust]]
=== menu:Organization Details[Trust]

Here establish trust between organizations.

image::admin_organization_trusts.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Such a trust allows sharing contents and migrate systems between these two organizations.
You may add a trust by checking the box next to an organization (or remove a trust by unchecking it) and clicking the btn:[Modify Trusts] button.



[[s2-sattools-org-details-conf]]
=== menu:Organization Details[Configuration]

Allow the Organization Administrator to manage Organization configuration, configure the organization to use staged contents ("`pre-fetching`" packages, etc.), set up software crash reporting, and upload of SCAP files.

image::admin_organization_configuration.png[scaledwidth=80%]

SUSE Manager Configuration::
Enable menu:SUSE Manager Configuration[Allow Organization Admin to manage Organization Configuration] if desired.

Organization Configuration::

* menu:Organization Configuration[Enable Staging Contents]
* menu:Organization Configuration[Enable Errata E-mail Notifications (for users belonging to this organization)]
* menu:Organization Configuration[Enable Software Crash Reporting]
* menu:Organization Configuration[Enable Upload Of Crash Files]
* menu:Organization Configuration[Crash File Upload Size Limit]
* menu:Organization Configuration[Enable Upload Of Detailed SCAP Files]
* menu:Organization Configuration[SCAP File Upload Size Limit]
* menu:Organization Configuration[Allow Deletion of SCAP Results]
* menu:Organization Configuration[Allow Deletion After (period in days)]

When settings are done, confirm with clicking the btn:[Update Organization] button.


Enable Staging Contents::
The clients will download packages in advance and stage them.
This has the advantage that the package installation action will take place immediately, when the schedule is actually executed.
This "`pre-fetching`" saves maintenance window time, which is good for service uptime.

For staging contents ("`pre-fetching`"), edit on the client [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date``:

----
stagingContent=1
stagingContentWindow=24
----

`stagingContentWindow` is a time value expressed in hours and determines when downloading will start.
It is the number of hours before the scheduled installation or update time.
In this case, it means `24` hours before the installation time.
The start time for download depends on the selected contact method for a system.
The assigned contact method sets the time for when the next [command]``rhn_check`` will be executed.

Next time an action is scheduled, packages will automatically be downloaded but not installed yet.
When the scheduled time comes, the action will use the staged version.


Minion Content Staging::
Every Organization administrator can enable Content Staging from the Organization configuration page menu:Admin[Organization > OrgName > Configuration > Enable Staging Contents].

Staging content for minions is affected by two parameters.

* [path]``salt_content_staging_advance:`` expresses the advance time, in hours, for the content staging window to open with regard to the scheduled installation/upgrade time.
* [path]``salt_content_staging_window:`` expresses the duration, in hours, of the time window for Salt minions to stage packages in advance of scheduled installations or upgrades.

A value of *salt_content_staging_advance* equal to *salt_content_staging_window* results in the content staging window closing exactly when the installation/upgrade is scheduled to be executed.
A larger value allows separating download time from the installation time.

These options are configured in [path]``/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java.conf``
 and by default assume the following values:

* [path]``salt_content_staging_advance: 8 hours``
* [path]``salt_content_staging_window: 8 hours``

[NOTE]
====
These parameters will only have an effect when Content Staging is enabled for the targeted Organization.
====



[[s2-sattools-org-details-states]]
=== menu:Organization Details[States]

From the menu:Admin[Organizations > States] page you can assign State to all systems in an organization.
For example, this way it is possible to define a few global security policies or add a common admin user to all machines.

image::admin_organization_states.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.admin.users]]
== menu:Main Menu[Admin > Users]

To view and manage all users of the organization you are currently logged in to, click menu:Main Menu[Admin > Users] in the left navigation bar.
The table lists user name, real name, organization and whether the user is organization or {productname} administrator.
To modify administrator privileges, click any user name with administrator privileges to get to the menu:Users[Users Details] page.
For more information, see:
// TODO: UPDATE LINK for github
 <<s3-sm-user-active-details>>.



[[ref.webui.admin.config]]
== menu:Main Menu[Admin > Manager Configuration]

The menu:Main Menu[Admin > Manager Configuration] page is split into tabs which allow you to configure many aspects of {productname}.



[[s3-sattools-config-gen]]
=== menu:Manager Configuration[General]

This page allows you to adjust basic {productname} administration settings.

image::admin_general_configuration.png[scaledwidth=80%]

menu:Administrator Email Address[]::
E-mail address of the {productname} administrator.

menu:SUSE Manager Hostname[]::
Host name of the {productname} server.

{productname} Proxy Configuration::
Configure proxy data via the following fields:
* menu:Manager Configuration[HTTP proxy]
* menu:Manager Configuration[HTTP proxy username]
* menu:Manager Configuration[HTTP proxy password]
* menu:Manager Configuration[Confirm HTTP proxy password]
+

The HTTP proxy settings are for the communication with a {productname} parent server, if there is any.
The HTTP proxy should be of the form: ``hostname:port``; the default port `8080` will be used if none is explicitly provided.
HTTP proxy settings for client systems to connect to this {productname} can be different, and will be configured separately, for example via:
// TODO: UPDATE LINK for github
<<s3-sattools-config-bootstrap>>.

menu:RPM repository mount point[]::
The directory where RPM packages are mirrored.
By default: [path]``/var/spacewalk``.

menu:Default To SSL[]::
For secure communication, use SSL.

When done, confirm with btn:[Update].



[[s3-sattools-config-bootstrap]]
=== menu:Manager Configuration[Bootstrap Script]

The menu:Manager Configuration[Bootstrap Script] page allows you to generate a bootstrap script that registers the client systems with {productname} and disconnects them from the remote {scc}.

[IMPORTANT]
.SLES 15 and Python 3
====
SLES 15 utilizes Python 3 as its default system version. Due to this change any older
bootstrap scripts(based on python 2) must be re-created for SLES 15 systems. Attempting to
register SLES 15 systems with SUSE Manager using Python 2 versions of the bootstrap script will
fail.
====

image::admin_configuration_bootstrap.png[scaledwidth=80%]

This generated script will be placed within the [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/`` directory on your {productname} server.
The bootstrap script will significantly reduce the effort involved in reconfiguring all systems, which by default obtain packages from the {scc}.
The required fields are pre-populated with values derived from previous installation steps.
Ensure this information is accurate.

SUSE Manager server hostname::
The name of the SUSE Manager server where you want to register the client (pre-populated).

SSL cert location::
Location and name of the SSL certificate (pre-populated).

Bootstrap using Salt::
To bootstrap traditional clients, uncheck menu:Client Bootstrap Script Configuration[Bootstrap using Salt].
For more information, see:
// TODO: update link for github
<<registering.clients.traditional>>.

Enable SSL::
It is advised keeping SSL enabled.
If enabled the corporate public CA certificate will be installed on the client.
If disabled the user must manage CA certificates to be able to run the registration ([command]``rhnreg_ks``).

Enable Client GPG checking::
GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)

Enable Remote Configuration::
Enable remote configuration management and remote command acceptance of the systems to be bootstrapped to the {productname}.
Both features are useful for completing client configuration.
For more information, see:
// TODO: Update link for github
<<ref.webui.config>> and <<s5-sm-system-details-remote>>.

Client HTTP Proxy::
Client HTTP proxy settings if you are using an HTTP proxy server.

When finished, click btn:[Update].



[[s3-sattools-config-orgs]]
=== menu:Manager Configuration[Organizations]

The menu:Manager Configuration[Organizations] page contains details about the organizations feature of {productname}, and links for creating and configuring organizations.

image::admin_configuration_organization.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[s3-sattools-config-restart]]
=== menu:Manager Configuration[Restart]

The menu:Manager Configuration[Restart] page comprises the final step in configuring {productname}.

image::admin_configuration_restart.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Click the btn:[Restart] button to restart {productname} and incorporate all of the configuration options added on the previous screens.
It will take between four and five minutes for a restart to finish.



[[s3-sattools-config-cobbler]]
=== menu:Manager Configuration[Cobbler]

On the menu:Manager Configuration[Cobbler] page you can run the Cobbler synchronization by clicking btn:[Update].

image::admin_configuration_cobbler.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Cobbler synchronization is used to repair or rebuild the contents of [path]``/srv/tftpboot`` or [path]``/srv/www/cobbler`` when a manual modification of the cobbler setup has occurred.



[[s3-sattools-config-bare-metal]]
=== menu:Manager Configuration[Bare-metal systems]

Here you can add unprovisioned ("bare-metal") systems capable of booting using PXE to an organization.

image::admin_configuration_bare_metal_systems.png[scaledwidth=80%]

First click btn:[Enable adding to this organization].
Those systems then will appear in the menu:Main Menu[Systems > All Systems] list, where regular provisioning via autoinstallation is possible in a completely unattended fashion.

Only AMD64/Intel 64 systems with at least 1 GB of RAM are supported.
{productname} server will use its integrated Cobbler instance and will act as TFTP server for this feature to work, so the network segment that connects it to target systems must be properly configured.
In particular, a DHCP server must exist and have a next-server configuration parameter set to the {productname} server IP address or hostname.

When enabled, any bare-metal system connected to the SUSE Manager server network will be automatically added to the organization when it powers on.
The process typically takes a few minutes; when it finishes, the system will automatically shut down and then appear in the menu:Main Menu[Systems > All Systems] list.

[NOTE]
====
New systems will be added to the organization of the administrator who enabled this feature.
To change the organization, disable the feature, log in as an administrator of a different organization and enable it again.
====

Provisioning can be initiated by clicking the btn:[Provisioning] tab.
In case of bare-metal systems, though, provisioning cannot be scheduled, it will happen automatically when it is completely configured and the system is powered on.

It is possible to use menu:Main Menu[Systems > System Set Manager] with bare-metal systems, although in that case some features will not be available as those systems do not have an operating system installed.
This limitation also applies to mixed sets with regular and bare-metal systems: full features will be enabled again when all bare-metal systems are removed from the set.



[[ref.webui.admin.iss]]
== menu:Main Menu[Admin > ISS Configuration]

Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) allows {productname} synchronizing content and permissions from another {productname} instance in a peer-to-peer relationship.



[[s3-sattools-iss-master]]
=== Configuring the Master {productname} Server

The following will help you set up a master ISS server.

image::admin_iss_configuration_master.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Click menu:Admin[>ISS Configuration > Master Setup].
In the top right-hand corner of this page, click btn:[Add New Slave]:

image::admin_iss_configuration_edit_slave.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Fill in the following information:

* Slave Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
* Allow Slave to Sync? Selecting this checkbox will allow the slave {productname} to access this master {productname}.
Otherwise, contact with this slave will be denied.
* Sync All Orgs to Slave? Checking this field will synchronize all organizations to the slave {productname}.


[NOTE]
====
Marking the menu:ISS Configuration[Sync All Orgs to Slave?] checkbox on the menu:ISS Configuration[Master Setup] page will override any specifically selected organizations in the local organization table.
====

Click btn:[Create].
Optionally, click any local organization to be exported to the slave {productname} then click btn:[Allow Orgs].

[NOTE]
.Enabling Inter-server Synchronization in {productname} 2.1
====
ISS is enabled by default in {productname} 3.1 and later.

To enable the inter-server synchronization (ISS) feature in {productname} 2.1, edit the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` file and set: [command]``disable_iss=0``.
Save the file and restart the httpd service with [command]``service httpd restart``.
====


For synchronization timeout settings, see:
// TODO update link for github
<<bp.troubleshooting.timeouts>>.



[[s3-sattools-iss-slave]]
=== Configuring Slave Servers

Slave servers receive content synchronized from the master server.

image::admin_iss_configuration_slave.png[scaledwidth=80%]

To securely transfer content to the slave servers, the ORG-SSL certificate from the master server is needed.
Click menu:Admin[ISS Configuration > Slave Setup].
In the top right-hand corner, click btn:[Add New Master].

image::admin_iss_configuration_edit_master.png[scaledwidth=80%]

menu:ISS Configuration[Update Master > Master Setup] and fill in the following information:

----
+

* Default Master?

Click btn:[Add New Master].
Once the master and slave servers are configured, start the synchronization on the Master server by executing [command]``mgr-inter-sync``:

----
mgr-inter-sync -c`YOUR-CHANNEL`
----


[[s3-sattools-iss-map-orgs]]
=== Mapping {productname} Master Server Organizations to Slave Organizations

A mapping between organizational names on the master {productname} allows for channel access permissions being set on the master server and propagated when content is synchronized to a slave {productname}.
Not all organization and channel details need to be mapped for all slaves.
{productname} administrators can select which permissions and organizations can be synchronized by allowing or omitting mappings.

To complete the mapping, log in to the Slave {productname} as administrator.
Click menu:Admin[ISS Configuration > Slave Setup] and select a master {productname} by clicking its name.
Use the drop-down box to map the exported master organization name to a matching local organization in the slave {productname}, then click btn:[Update Mapping].

On the command line, issue the synchronization command on each of the custom channels to obtain the correct trust structure and channel permissions:

----
mgr-inter-sync -c`YOUR-CHANNEL`
----



[[ref.webui.admin.schedules]]
