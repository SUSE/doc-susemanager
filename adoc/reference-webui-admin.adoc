The menu:Admin[]
 pages allows {susemgr}
 customers to manage the basic configuration, including creating and managing multiple organizations.
Only the {susemgr}
 administrator can access the menu:Admin[]
 pages. 

[[_ref.webui.admin.wizard]]
== menu:Admin[] > menu:Setup Wizard[]


Setting up {susemgr}
typically requires some extra steps after installation for common configuration tasks. 

The menu:Setup Wizard[]
 link is displayed when the {susemgr}
 Web interface is used for the fist time and can be accessed later at any time by clicking menu:Admin[Setup
   Wizard]
.
On the three tabs configure the HTTP proxy server, organization credentials, and {suse}
 products. 

menu:HTTP Proxy:[]::
Configure a proxy server that {susemgr}
will use to access SCC ({suse}
Customer Center) and other remote servers here. 
+
image::admin_proxy_settings.png[]
+
Use `hostname:port` syntax in the menu:Hostname[]
field if the proxy port is not 8080.
Clearing the fields disables proxy. 

menu:Organization Credentials:[]::
Click menu:Add a new credential[]
and enter user name and password to allow a user to access SCC. 
+
image::admin_organization_credentials.png[]
+
After saving, a new credential card will be displayed.
Buttons below the credential card allow you to: 

* see the credential validation status (green tick or red cross icon). To re-check the credential with SCC, click the icon; 
* set the primary credentials for inter-server synchronization (yellow star icon); 
* list the subscriptions related to a certain credential (list icon); 
* edit the credential (pencil icon); 
* delete the credential (trash can icon). 

menu:SUSE Products:[]::
On the menu:SUSE Products[]
page, select product-specific channels you are entitled to. 
+
image::admin_suse_products.png[]
+
The products displayed are directly linked to your organization credentials and your {suse}
subscriptions.
Product extentions and modules are shown when you select the corresponding base product or click the plus sign to its left.
After you have made your selection, click menu:Add products[]
.
This equals running [command]``mgr-sync add products`` or [command]``mgr-sync`` without any argument. 
+


.Synchronization Time
[NOTE]
====
Channel synchronization will start and might take several hours.
When finished the corresponding channels can be used in {susemgr}
. 
====
+

.If Synchronization Fails
[IMPORTANT]
====
SUSE does not automatically trust 3rd party GPG keys.
Should a reposync fail you can detect if an untrusted GPG key is the root cause by viewing log files located in: 

----
/var/log/rhn/reposync
----

Look for lines similar to the following: 

----
['/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync', '--channel', 'sle-12-sp1-ga-desktop-
      nvidia-driver-x86_64', '--type', 'yum', '--non-interactive']
    ChannelException: The GPG key for this repository is not part of
      the keyring.
    Please run spacewalk-repo-sync in interactive mode to import it.
----
====
+
Alternatively, you can add listed channels right away by clicking the menu:Add this product[]
button in the status column.
A progress bar will be displayed.
The main product will expand, and now you can select add-on products belonging to the product that is currently added.
To check for required channels, click the list icon in the menu:Channels[]
column.
When a product is downloaded and ready to use, the state will change to menu:Finished[]
. 

[[_ref.webui.admin.org]]
== menu:Admin[] > menu:Organizations[]


The organizations feature allows {susemgr}
administrators to create and manage multiple organizations across {susemgr}
.
Administrators can control an organization's access to system management tasks. 
image::admin_list_organizations.png[]


If you click the name of an organization, the Organization Details page appears. 

[[_s2_sattools_org_details_details]]
=== menu:Organization Details[] > menu:Details[]


The menu:Organization Details[]
 page lists the details of the selected organization. 
image::admin_organization_details.png[]


The following details are avialable: 

* menu:Organization Name[] : String (between 3 and 128 characters). This is the only value that you can change here. When done, confirm with clicking the menu:Update Organization[] button. 
* menu:Organization ID[] : Number 
* menu:Active Users[] : Number. Clicking this number will open the menu:Users[] tab. For more information, see <<_s2_sattools_org_details_users>>. 
* menu:Systems[] : Number 
* menu:System Groups[] : Number 
* menu:Activation Keys[] : Number 
* menu:Autoinstallation Profiles[] : Number 
* menu:Configuration Channels[] : Number 


[[_s2_sattools_org_details_users]]
=== menu:Organization Details[] > menu:Users[]


List of all the users of an organization. 
image::admin_organization_users.png[]


You can modify the user details if you belong to that organization and have organization administrator privileges.
For more information, see <<_ref.webui.admin.users>>. 

[[_s2_sattools_org_details_trust]]
=== menu:Organization Details[] > menu:Trust[]


Here establish trust between organizations. 
image::admin_organization_trusts.png[]


Such a trust allows sharing contents and migrate systems between these two organizations.
You may add a trust by checking the box next to an organization (or remove a trust by unchecking it) and clicking the menu:Modify Trusts[]
 button. 

[[_s2_sattools_org_details_conf]]
=== menu:Organization Details[] > menu:Configuration[]


Here you enable the Organization Administrator to manage Organization configuration, configure the organization to use staged contents ("`pre-fetching`"
 packages, etc.), set up software crash reporting, and upload of SCAP files. 
image::admin_organization_configuration.png[]



SUSE Manager Configuration::
Enable menu:Allow Organization Admin to manage Organization Configuration[]
if wanted. 

Organization Configuration::

* menu:Enable Staging Contents[]
* menu:Enable Errata E-mail Notifications (for users belonging to this organization)[]
* menu:Enable Software Crash Reporting[]
* menu:Enable Upload Of Crash Files[]
* menu:Crash File Upload Size Limit[]
* menu:Enable Upload Of Detailed SCAP Files[]
* menu:SCAP File Upload Size Limit[]
* menu:Allow Deletion of SCAP Results[]
* menu:Allow Deletion After (period in days)[]

When settings are done, confirm with clicking the menu:Update Organization[]
 button. 

.Enable Staging Contents
The clients will download packages in advance and stage them.
This has the advantage that the package installation action will take place immediately, when the schedule is actually executed.
This "`pre-fetching`"
 saves maintenance window time, which is good for service uptime. 


For staging contents ("`pre-fetching`"
), edit on the client [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date``
: 

----
stagingContent=1
stagingContentWindow=24
----

`stagingContentWindow` is a time value expressed in hours and determines when downloading will start.
It is the number of hours before the scheduled installation or update time.
In this case, it means `24` hours before the installation time.
The exact download start time depends on the contact method{mdash}
when the next [command]``rhn_check`` is performed. 

Next time an action is scheduled, packages will automatically be downloaded but not installed yet.
When the scheduled time comes, the action will use the staged version. 

.Minion Content Staging
Every Organization administrator can enable Content Staging from the Organization configuration page menu:Admin[Organization > OrgName > Configuration > Enable Staging
     Contents]
. 


Staging content for minions is affected by two parameters. 

* [path]``salt_content_staging_advance:`` expresses the advance time, in hours, for the content staging window to open with regard to the scheduled installation/upgrade time. 
* [path]``salt_content_staging_window:`` expresses the duration, in hours, of the time window for Salt minions to stage packages in advance of scheduled installations or upgrades. 


A value of *salt_content_staging_advance* equal to *salt_content_staging_window* results in the content staging window closing exactly when the installation/upgrade is scheduled to be executed, a larger value allows  separating the download time from the installation time. 

These options are configured in [path]``/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java.conf``
 and by default assume the following values: 

* [path]``salt_content_staging_advance: 8 hours``
* [path]``salt_content_staging_window: 8 hours``


[NOTE]
====
These parameters will only have an effect when Content Staging is enabled for the targeted Organization. 
====

[[_s2_sattools_org_details_states]]
=== menu:Organization Details[] > menu:States[]


From the menu:Admin[Organizations > States]
 page you can assign State Channels to all systems in an organization.

menu:Administrator Email Address[]::
E-mail address of the {susemgr}
administrator. 

menu:SUSE Manager Hostname[]::
Host name of the {susemgr}
server. 

{susemgr} Proxy Configuration::
menu:HTTP proxy[]
, menu:HTTP proxy username[]
, menu:HTTP proxy password[]
, and menu:Confirm HTTP proxy password[]
. 
+
The HTTP proxy settings are for the communication with a {susemgr}
parent server, if there is any.
The HTTP proxy should be of the form: ``hostname:port``; the default port `8080` will be used if none is explicitly provided.
HTTP proxy settings for client systems to connect to this {susemgr}
can be different, and will be configured separately, for example via <<_s3_sattools_config_bootstrap>>. 

menu:RPM repository mount point[]::
The directory where RPM packages are mirrored.
By default: [path]``/var/spacewalk``
. 

menu:Default To SSL[]::
For secure communication, use SSL. 


When done, confirm with menu:Update[]
. 

[[_s3_sattools_config_bootstrap]]
=== menu:Admin[] > menu:Manager Configuration[] > menu:Bootstrap Script[]


The menu:Manager Configuration[Bootstrap Script]
 page allows you to generate a bootstrap script that registers the client systems with {susemgr}
 and disconnects them from the remote {scc}
. 
image::admin_configuration_bootstrap.png[]


This generated script will be placed within the [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/``
 directory on your {susemgr}
 server.
The bootstrap script will significantly reduce the effort involved in reconfiguring all systems, which by default obtain packages from the {scc}
.
The required fields are pre-populated with values derived from previous installation steps.
Ensure this information is accurate. 

SUSE Manager server hostname::
The name of the SUSE Manager server where you want to register the client (pre-populated). 

SSL cert location::
Location and name of the SSL certificate (pre-populated). 

Bootstrap using Salt::
To bootstrap traditional clients, uncheck menu:Bootstrap using Salt[]
.
For more information, see <<_registering.clients.traditional>>. 

Enable SSL::
It is advised keeping SSL enabled.
If enabled the corporate public CA certificate will be installed on the client.
If disabled the user must manage CA certificates to be able to run the registration ([command]``rhnreg_ks``). 

Enable Client GPG checking::
GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) 

Enable Remote Configuration::
Enable remote configuration management and remote command acceptance of the systems to be bootstrapped to the {susemgr}
.
Both features are useful for completing client configuration.
For more information, see <<_ref.webui.config>> and <<_s5_sm_system_details_remote>>. 

Client HTTP Proxy::
Client HTTP proxy settings if you are using an HTTP proxy server.

 page comprises the final step in configuring {susemgr}
. 
image::admin_configuration_restart.png[]


Click the menu:Restart[]
 button to restart {susemgr}
 and incorporate all of the configuration options added on the previous screens.
It will take between four and five minutes for the restart to finish. 

[[_s3_sattools_config_cobbler]]
=== menu:Admin[] > menu:Manager Configuration[] > menu:Cobbler[]


On the menu:Manager Configuration[Cobbler]
 page you can run the Cobbler synchronization by clicking menu:Update[]
. 
image::admin_configuration_cobbler.png[]


Cobbler synchronization is used to repair or rebuild the contents of [path]``/srv/tftpboot``
 or [path]``/srv/www/cobbler``
 when a manual modification of the cobbler setup has occurred. 

[[_s3_sattools_config_bare_metal]]
=== menu:Admin[] > menu:Manager Configuration[] > menu:Bare-metal systems[]


Here you can add unprovisioned ("bare-metal") systems capable of booting using PXE to an organization. 
image::admin_configuration_bare_metal_systems.png[]


First click menu:Enable adding to this organization[]
.
Those systems then will appear in the menu:Systems[]
 list, where regular provisioning via autoinstallation is possible in a completely unattended fashion.
Only AMD64/Intel 64 systems with at least 1 GB of RAM are supported. {susemgr}
 server will use its integrated Cobbler instance and will act as TFTP server for this feature to work, so the network segment that connects it to target systems must be properly configured.
In particular, a DHCP server must exist and have a next-server configuration parameter set to the {susemgr}
 server IP address or hostname. 

When enabled, any bare-metal system connected to the SUSE Manager server network will be automatically added to the organization when it powers on.
The process typically takes a few minutes; when it finishes, the system will automatically shut down and then appear in the menu:Systems[]
 list. 

[NOTE]
====
New systems will be added to the organization of the administrator who enabled this feature.
To change the organization, disable the feature, log in as an administrator of a different organization and enable it again. 
====


Provisioning can be initiated by clicking the menu:Provisioning[]
 tab.
In case of bare-metal systems, though, provisioning cannot be scheduled, it will happen automatically when it is completely configured and the system is powered on. 

It is possible to use menu:System Set Manager[]
 with bare-metal systems, although in that case some features will not be available as those systems do not have an operating system installed.
This limitation also applies to mixed sets with regular and bare-metal systems: full features will be enabled again when all bare-metal systems are removed from the set. 

[[_ref.webui.admin.iss]]
== menu:Admin[] > menu:ISS Configuration[]
