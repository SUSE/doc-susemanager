= Set the Cluster Password for Hawk
include::entities.adoc[]

You should now set a password for the *hacluster* _user_ who is part of the *haclient* _group_

Run the following command as {ruser} to set the *hacluster* password:

----
passwd hacluster
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully

[NOTE]
.User Authentication
====
Hawk users must be members of the haclient group. The installation creates a Linux user named hacluster, who is added to the haclient group. When using the ha-cluster-init script for setup, a default password is set for the hacluster user.

Before starting Hawk, set or change the password for the hacluster user. Alternatively, create a new user which is a member of the haclient group.

Do this on every node you will connect to with Hawk.
