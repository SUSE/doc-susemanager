The migration from {productname} 2.1 to {productname} 3 works in the same way as a migration from Red Hat Satellite to {productname}.
The migration happens from the original machine to a new one.
There is no in-place migration.
While this has the drawback that you temporarily need two machines, it also has the advantage that the original machine will remain fully functional in case something goes wrong.

.Migration Process
[IMPORTANT]
====
The whole process may be tricky, so it is strongly advised that the migration is done by an experienced consultant.
====


Given the complexity of the product, the migration is an "`all-or-nothing`"
 procedure{mdash}
if something goes wrong you will need to start all over.
Error handling is very limited.
Nevertheless it should work more or less out of the box if all the steps are carefully executed as documented.

.Time-Consuming Operation
[NOTE]
====
The migration involves dumping the whole database on the source machine and restoring it on the target machine.
Also all of the channels and packages need to be copied to the new machine, so expect the whole migration to take several hours,
====

[[bp.sec.mgr.migration.prereq]]
== Prerequisites

.Latest Updates
[WARNING]
====
The source machine needs to run {productname} 2.1 with all the latest updates applied.
Before starting the migration process, make sure that the machine is up to date and all updates have been installed sucessfully.
====


Only machines running with the embedded PostgreSQL database may be migrated in one go.
For the migration of an Oracle based installation, a two-step migration is required: First the installation needs to get migrated from Oracle to PostgreSQL (by means of a separate tool) and afterwards the migration to {productname} 3 can be performed as documented here.

{productname} 3 no longer supports {ncc} but only SCC ({scc}).
Therefore, you can migrate a machine only after it has been switched to SCC.
The migration script will check if the installation has already been switched to SCC and will terminate if this is not the case.
Switch to SCC on the source machine and repeat the migration.
During migration the database from the source machine needs to get dumped and this dump needs to be temporarily stored on the target system.
The dump gets compressed with [command]``gzip`` using the default compression options (maximum compression only yields about 10% of space savings but costs a lot of runtime); so check the disk usage of the database with:

----
{prompt.root}du -sch /var/lib/pgsql/data
----


This will ensure that you have at least 30 % of this value available in [path]``/var/spacewalk/tmp``
.

These values from a test migration should aid in illustrating space requirements:

----
suma21:/var/lib/pgsql# du -sch data
1,8G    data
1,8G    total
suma21:/var/spacewalk/tmp# ls -lh susemanager.dmp.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 506M Jan 12 14:58 susemanager.dmp.gz
----


This is a small test installation; for bigger installations the ratio might be better (space required for the database dump might be less than 30%). The dump will be written to the directory [path]``/var/spacewalk/tmp``
, the directory will be created if it does not exist yet.
If you want the dump to be stored somewhere else, change the definition of the variable [var]``$TMPDIR`` on the beginning of the script to suit your needs.

[[bp.sec.mgr.migration.setup.target]]
== Setup the Target Machine


To prepare the target machine (with the example host name ``suma30``) proceed as follows:

[[proc.mgr.migration.setup.target]]
.Procedure: Setup Target Machine
. On the target machine install {sls} 12 SP2 including the extension product "`{productname}`" .
+
.Background Information on Required Target Machine
IMPORTANT: It is actually required to install version 12 SP2 on the target machine.
On that version you will upgrade the PostgreSQL database from version_9.4 to 9.6.
For more information about the PostgreSQL upgrade, see <<sp.migration.postgresql>>.
+

. Initiate [command]``yast2 susemanagersetup`` as you would normally do for an installation of {productname}.
+
For more information about installing {productname}, see <<sles.installation.within.kvm.jeos>>.
. On the first {productname} setup screen, ensure that menu:Migrate a SUSE Manager compatible server[] is marked instead of menu:Set up SUSE Manager from scratch[] .
. On the second screen, enter the name of the source system as menu:Hostname of source SUSE Manager Server[] as well as the domain name. Also enter the database credentials of the source system.
. On the next screen, you will need to specify the IP address of the {productname} 3 target system. Normally this value should be pre-set to the correct value and you only should need to press kbd:[Enter] . Only in the case of multiple IP addresses you might need to specify the one that should be used during migration.
+
.Faking the Host Name
IMPORTANT: During the migration process, the target system will fake its host name to be the same as the source system, this is necessary as the host name of a {productname} installation is vital and should not be changed once set.
Therefore do not be confused when logging in to your systems during migration; they both will present you with the same host name.
+

. Continue by following the normal installation steps.
+
.Database Parameters
IMPORTANT: Specify the database parameters using the same database parameters as the source system is recommended.
At least, using the the same database credentials as when creating the source or original {productname} database is mandatory.
+


+
Enter your SCC credentials.
After all the data has been gathered, {yast}
will terminate.


The actual migration will not start automatically but needs to be triggered manually as outlined in <<bp.sec.mgr.migration.performing>>.

[[bp.sec.mgr.migration.performing]]
== Performing the Migration


A migration is performed by excecuting the following command:

----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/mgr-setup -m
----


This command reads the data gathered during <<proc.mgr.migration.setup.target>>, sets up {productname} onto a new target machine and transfers all of the data from the source machine.
As several operations need to be performed on the source machine via SSH, you will be prompted once for the root password of the source machine.
A temporary SSH key named `migration-key` is created and installed on the source machine, so you need to give the {rootuser}
 password only once.
The temporary SSH key will be deleted after successful migration.
Ideally, this is all you will need to do.

Depending on the size of the installation, the actual migration will take up to several hours.
Once finished, you will be prompted to shutdown the source machine, re-configure the network of the target machine to use the same IP address and host name as the original machine and restart it.
It should now be a fully functional replacement for your previous {productname} 2.1 installation.
The following numbers illustrate the runtime for dumping and importing a small database:

----
14:53:37   Dumping remote database to /var/spacewalk/tmp/susemanager.dmp.gz on target system. Please wait...
14:58:14   Database successfully dumped. Size is: 506M
14:58:29   Importing database dump. Please wait...
15:05:11   Database dump successfully imported.
----


For this example dumping the database takes around five minutes to complete.
Importing the dump onto the target system will take an additional seven minutes.
For big installations this can take up to several hours.
You should also account for the time it takes to copy all the package data to the new machine.
Depending on your network infrastructure and hardware, this can also take a significant amount of time.

[[bp.sec.mgr.migration.speedup]]
== Speeding up the Migration


A complete migration can consume a lot of time.
This is caused by the amount of data that must be copied.
Total migration time can be greatly decreased by eliminating the need to copy data prior to performing the migration (for example, channels, packages, auto-install images, and any additional data). You can gather all data via {yast}
by running the command [command]``mgr-setup -r``.

Executing [command]``mgr-setup -r`` will copy the data from the old server to the new one.
This command may be run at any time and your current server will remain fully functional.
Once the migration has been initiated only data changed since running [command]``mgr-setup -r`` will need to be transferred which will significantly reduces downtime.

On large installations transfering the database (which involves dumping the database onto the source machine and then importing the dump onto the target system) will still take some time.
During the database transfer no write operations should occur therefore the migration script will shut down any {productname} database services running on the source machine.

[[bp.sec.mgr.migration.pkg.extern]]
== Packages on External Storage


Some installations may store the package data on external storage (for example, NFS mount on [path]``/var/spacewalk/packages``
). You do not need to copy this data to the new machine.
Edit the script located in [path]``/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/mgr-setup``
 and remove the respective [command]``rsync`` command (located around line 345).

.Mounting External Storage
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure your external storage is mounted on the new machine before starting the system for the first time.
Analogue handling for [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub``
 if appropriate.

In general, all needed files and directories, not copied by the migration tool, should be copied to the new server manually.
====

[[bp.sec.mgr.migration.trouble]]
== Troubleshooting a Broken {webui} after Migration


It is possible that the {webui}
may break during migration.
This behavior is not a bug, but a browser caching issue.
The new machine has the same host name and IP address as the old machine.
This duplication can confuse some Web browsers.
If you experience this issue reload the page.
For example, in Firefox pressing the key combination kbd:[Ctrl+F5]
 should resume normal functionality.
