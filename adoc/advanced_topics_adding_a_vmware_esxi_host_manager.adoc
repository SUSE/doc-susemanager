== Introduction

Foreign virtual hosts (such as vCenter and vSphere ESXi) can be inventoried using the [guimenu]``Virtual Host Manager``.
From the vSphere Client you can define roles and permissions for vCenter and vSphere ESXi users allowing vSphere objects and resources to be imported and inventoried by {productname}.
Objects and resources are then displayed as foreign hosts on the {productname} menu:Systems[Virtual Systems] page.

The following sections will guide you through:

* Requirements
* Overview of permissions and roles
* Adding vCenter and vSphere ESXi hosts to {productname}




== Requirements

This table displays the default API communication port and required access rights for inventorying objects and resources:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Ports / Permissions | Description
| 443 | Default port that {productname} uses to access the ESXi API for obtaining infrastructure data
| read-only | All vCenter/ESXi objects and resources that should be inventoried by the Virtual Host Manager should be at least assigned the _read-only_ role.
Mark objects and resources with _no-access_ to exclude them from the inventory.
|===



== Permissions and Roles Overview

This section will guide you through assigning user permissions and roles in vCenter/ESXi.

A user is someone who has been authorized to access an ESXi host.
The Virtual Host Manager (located on the SUSE Manager server) will inventory ESXi data defined by assigned roles and permissions on a user account.

For example: The user _John_ has been assigned the _read-only_ access role to all servers and datacenters in his company with one exception.
John's account has been assigned the _no-access_ role on the company's _Financial Database server_.
You decide to use John's user account and add the ESXi host to SUSE Manager.
During the inventory the _Financial Database server_ will be excluded.

Keep user access roles in mind when planning to add ESXi hosts to SUSE manager.
Note that SUSE Manager will not inventory any objects or resources assigned with the _no-access_ role on any user account.


[TIP]
.User Roles/Permissions
====
When planning to add new ESXi hosts to SUSE Manager, consider if the roles and permissions assigned users require need to be inventoried by SUSE Manager.
====



== Adding New Users and Assigning Roles

See the official vSphere documentation on adding new users and assigning roles.

== Inventorying vCenter/vSphere ESXi Hosts

This procedure guides you through inventorying a VSphere ESXi host with {productname}.

. From the {productname} {webui} select menu:Main Menu[Systems > Virtual Host Managers] from the left navigation bar.
. From the upper right corner of the _Virtual Host Managers_ page select btn:[Create] VMWare-based.
. From the _Add a VMware-based Virtual Host Manager_ page complete these fields with your ESXi host data:

Label::
Custom name for your Virtual Host Manager

Hostname::
Fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or host IP address

Port::
Default ESXi API port

Username::
Assign a username
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember that only objects and resources which match a user's defined role will be inventoried.
Set the user's role on objects and resources you want inventoried to _read-only_.
====
+

Password::
ESXi users password
+

. Click the btn:[Create] button.
. From the menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers] page select the new Virtual Host manager.
. From the menu:Virtual Host Managers[Properties] page click the btn:[Refresh] button.
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not refresh the data from a new Virtual Host Manager, host data will not be inventoried and therefore will not be displayed under menu:Systems[Virtual Systems].
====
+

. View inventoried ESXi host objects and resources by selecting menu:Systems[Virtual Systems] .
