=== Server Configuration for {rhel} Channels
// ianew: admin/clients-rh.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-03-01

This section provides guidance on server configuration for {rhel} Channels provided by {suse}.

* Minimum of 8 GB RAM and at least two physical or virtual CPUs. Taskomatic will use one of these CPUs.
* Taskomatic requires of minimum of 3072 MB RAM. This should be set in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:
+

----
taskomatic.java.maxmemory=3072
----
* Provision enough disk space. [path]``/var/spacewalk`` contains all mirrored RPMs. For example, {rhel} 6 x86_64 channels require 90 GB and more.
* LVM or an NFS mount is recommended.
* Access to RHEL 5/6/7 Subscription Media.


.Access to RHEL Media or Repositories
[WARNING]
====
Access to Red Hat base media repositories and RHEL installation media is the responsibility of the user.
Ensure that all your RHEL systems obtain support from RHEL or all your RHEL systems obtain support from {suse}.
If you do not follow these practices you may violate terms with Red Hat.

[[bp.expanded-support.resclients.tips]]
=== {rhel} Channel Management Tips
// ianew: admin/clients-rh.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-03-01

This section provides tips on {rhel} channel management.

* The base parent distribution {rhel} channel per architecture contains zero packages. No base media is provided by {suse}. The RHEL media or installation ISOs should be added as child channels of the {rhel} parent channel.
* The {rhel} and tools channels are provided by SUSE Customer Center (SCC) using [command]``mgr-sync``.
* It can take up to 24 hours for an initial channel synchronization to complete.
* When you have completed the initial synchronization process of any {rhel} channel it is recommended to clone the channel before working with it. This provides you with a backup of the original synchronization.


=== Mirroring RHEL Media into a Channel



The following procedure guides you through setup of the RHEL media as a {productname} channel.
All packages on the RHEL media will be mirrored into a child channel located under RES 5/6/7 distribution per architecture.

.Procedure: Mirroring RHEL Media into a Channel
. Create a new Channel by log in to the {webui} and selecting menu:Channels[Manage Software Channels > Create Channel] .
. Fill in basic channel details and add the channel as a child to the corresponding RES 5/6/7 distribution channel per architecture from SCC. The base parent channel should contain zero packages.
. Modify the RES 5/6/7 activation key to include this new child channel.
. As {rootuser} on the {productname} command line copy the ISO to the [path]``/tmp`` directory.

. Create a directory to contain the media content:
+

----
{prompt.root}mkdir -p /srv/www/htdocs/pub/rhel
----
. Mount the ISO:
+

----
{prompt.root}mount -o loop /tmp/name_of_iso /srv/www/htdocs/pub/rhel
----
. Start [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` to synchronize {rhel} 7 packages:
+

----
{prompt.root}spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/
Repo URL: https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/
Packages in repo:              [...]
Packages already synced:       [...]
Packages to sync:              [...]
[...]
----
+
To synchronize RES 5/6 packages:
+
----
{prompt.root}spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/Server/
Repo URL: https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/Server/
Packages in repo:              [...]
Packages already synced:       [...]
Packages to sync:              [...]
[...]
----

. When the channel has completed the synchronization process you can use the channel as any normal {productname} channel.


Attempting to synchronize the repository will sometimes fail with this error:

----
[Errno 256] No more mirrors to try.
----

To troubleshoot this error, look at the HTTP protocol to determine if [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` is running:

.procedure: Debug spacewalk-repo-sync
. Start debugging mode with [command]``export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG``
. Check the output of [command]``/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel _<channel-label>_ --type yum``
. If you want to disable debug mode, use [command]``unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG``




=== Registering RES Salt Minions with {productname}

This section will guide you through registering RHEL minions with {productname}.

This section assumes you have updated your server to the latest patch level.

==== Synchronizing Appropriate {rhel} Channels


Ensure you have the corresponding {rhel} product enabled and required channels have been fully synchronized:

.RHEL 7.x
* Product: {rhel} 7
* Mandatory channels: [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-7`` , [systemitem]``res7-suse-manager-tools-x86_64`` , [systemitem]``res7-x86_64`` systemitem>


.RHEL 6.x
* Product: {rhel} 6
* Mandatory channels: [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-6`` , [systemitem]``res6-suse-manager-tools-x86_64`` , [systemitem]``res6-x86_64``


.Checking Synchronization Progress
[TIP]
====
To check if a channel has finished synchronizing you can do one of the following:

* From the {productname}{webui} browse to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the menu:SUSE Products[] tab. Here you will find a percent completion bar for each product.

* Alternatively, you may check the synchronization log file located under [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync/channel-label.log`` using cat or the tailf command. Keep in mind that base channels can contain multiple child channels. Each of these child channels will generate its own log during the synchronization progress. Do not assume a channel has finished synchronizing until you have checked all relevant log files including base and child channels.

====


Create an activation key associated with the {rhel} channel.

==== Creating a Bootstrap Repository


The following procedure demonstrate creating a bootstrap repository for RHEL:


. On the server command line as root, create a bootstrap repo for RHEL with the following command:
+

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo RHEL_activation_channel_key
----
+
If you use a dedicated channel per RHEL version, specify it with the [literal]``--with-custom-channel`` option.

. Rename [command]``bootstrap.sh`` to [command]``resversion-boostrap.sh``:
+

----
{prompt.root}cp bootstrap.sh res7-bootstrap.sh
----


=== Register a Salt Minion via Bootstrap


The following procedure will guide you through registering a Salt minion using the bootstrap script.

.Procedure: Registration Using the Bootstrap Script
. For your new minion download the bootstrap script from the {productname} server:
+

----
wget --no-check-certificate https://`server`/pub/bootstrap/res7-bootstrap.sh
----
. Add the appropriate res-gpg-pubkey-#####-#####.key to the `ORG_GPG_KEY` key parameter, comma delimited in your [command]``res7-bootstrap.sh`` script. These are located on your {productname} server at:
+

----
http://`server`/pub/
----
. Make the [command]``res7-bootstrap.sh`` script executable and run it. This will install necessary Salt packages from the bootstrap repository and start the Salt minion service:
+

----
{prompt.root}chmod +x res7-bootstrap.sh{prompt.root}./res7-boostrap.sh
----

. From the {productname} {webui} select menu:Salt[Keys] and accept the new minion's key.



.Troubleshooting Bootstrap
[IMPORTANT]
====
If bootstrapping a minion fails it is usually caused by missing packages.
These missing packages are contained on the RHEL installation media.
The RHEL installation media should be loop mounted and added as a child channel to the {rhel} channel.
See the warning in <<bp.expanded-support.resclients>> on access to RHEL Media.
====

=== Manual Salt Minion Registration


The following procedure will guide you through the registration of a Salt minion manually.


. Add the bootstrap repository:
+

----
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://`server`/pub/repositories/res/7/bootstrap
----
. Install the [package]#salt-minion# package:
+

----
{prompt.root}yum install salt-minion
----
. Edit the Salt minion configuration file to point to the {productname} server:
+

----
{prompt.root}mkdir /etc/salt/minion.d{prompt.root}echo "master:`server_fqdn`" > /etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf
----
. Start the minion service:
+

----
{prompt.root}systemctl start salt-minion
----

. From the {productname} {webui} select the menu:Salt[Keys] and accept the new minion's key.



[[bp.expanded-support.centos_repos.trad]]
== Preparing Channels and Repositories for CentOS Traditional Clients
// ianew: admin/clients-centos.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-03-01

This following section provides an example procedure for configuring CentOS channels and repositories and finally registering a CentOS client with {productname}.

These steps will be identical for Scientific Linux and Fedora.

.Procedure: Preparing Channels and Repositories
. As {rootuser} install [package]#spacewalk-utils# on your {productname} server:
+

----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----
+
.Supported Tools
IMPORTANT: The [package]#spacewalk-utils# package contains a collection of upstream command line tools which provide assistance with spacewalk administrative operations.
You will be using the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` tool.
Keep in mind {suse} only provides support for [command]``spacewalk-clone-by-date`` and [command]``spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle`` tools.
+

. Run the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` script to add the CentOS7 base, updates, and Spacewalk client channels.
+

----
{prompt.root}spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -p`secret`-a x86_64 'centos7'{prompt.root}spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -p`secret`-a x86_64 'centos7-updates'{prompt.root}spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -p`secret`-a x86_64 'spacewalk26-client-centos7'
----
+
.Required Channel References
NOTE: The [path]``/etc/rhn/spacewalk-common-channels.ini`` must contain the channel references to be added.
If a channel is not listed, check the latest version here for updates: https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/tree/master/utils
+

. From the {webui} select menu:Main Menu[Software > Manage Software Channels > Overview]. Select the base channel you want to synchronize, in this case ``CentOS7 (x86_64)``. Select menu:Repositories[Sync]. Check the channels you want to synchronize and then click the btn:[Sync Now] button or, optionally, schedule a regular synchronization time.
. Copy all relevant GPG keys to [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub``. Depending on what distribution you are interested in managing these could include an EPEL key, SUSE keys, Red Hat keys, and CentOS keys. After copying these you can reference them in a comma-delimited list within your bootstrap script (see <<proc.bp.expanded-support.centos-repos.trad.bsscript>>).
** CentOS7 key files: http://mirror.centos.org/centos/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7
** EPEL key file: http://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora-epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7
** Spacewalk key: http://spacewalk.redhat.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk-2015
** Red Hat keys: http://www.redhat.com/contact/security-response-team/gpg-keys.html
. Install and setup a CentOS 7 client with the default installation packages.
. Ensure the client machine can resolve itself and your {productname} server via DNS. Validate that there is an entry in [path]``/etc/hosts`` for the real IP address of the client.
. Create an activation key (``centos7``) on the {productname} server that points to the correct parent/child channels, including the CentOS base repo, updates, and Spacewalk client.


Now prepare the bootstrap script.

[[proc.bp.expanded-support.centos-repos.trad.bsscript]]
.Procedure: Preparing the Bootstrap Script
. Create/edit your bootstrap script to correctly reflect the following:
+

----
# can be edited, but probably correct (unless created during initial install):

# NOTE: ACTIVATION_KEYS *must* be used to bootstrap a client machine.

ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-centos7

ORG_GPG_KEY=res.key,RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7,suse-307E3D54.key,suse-9C800ACA.key,RPM-GPG-KEY-spacewalk-2015

FULLY_UPDATE_THIS_BOX=0

yum clean all
# Install the prerequisites
yum -y install yum-rhn-plugin rhn-setup
----
. Add the following lines to the bottom of your script, (just before `echo "`-bootstrap complete -`"`):
+

----
# This section is for commands to be executed after registration
mv /etc/yum.repos.d/Cent* /root/
yum clean all
chkconfig rhnsd on
chkconfig osad on
service rhnsd restart
service osad restart
----
. Continue by following normal bootstrap procedures to bootstrap the new client.

[[bp.expanded-support.ubuntu]]
== Managing {ubuntu} Clients
// ianew: clientconfig/ubuntu-clients.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-03-01

Support for {ubuntu} Clients was added in {susemgr} 3.2.
Currently, Salt minions running {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS are supported.

[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} clients must be Salt minions.
Traditional clients are not supported.
====

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {ubuntu} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.
However, the root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default, so in order to use bootstrapping, you will require an existing user with [command]``sudo`` privileges for Python.

Other supported features:

* Synchronizing [systemitem]``.deb`` channels
* Assigning [systemitem]``.deb`` channels to minions
* GPG signing [systemitem]``.deb`` repositories
* Minion cleanup on delete
* Information displayed in System details pages
* Package install, update, and remove
* Package install using [systemitem]``Package States``
* Configuration and state channels

Some actions are not yet supported:

* Patch and errata support
* Bare metal installations, PXE booting, and virtual host provisioning
* Live patching
* CVE Audit
* If you use are using a repository from storage media (`server.susemanager.fromdir = ...` option in rhn.conf), Ubuntu Client Tools will not work.
// Reason: RMT and SMT cannot mirror Debian repositories (yet) and so cannot create it in that directory the correct files.
// We are waiting for SMT to release the feature/fix to mirror Debian repositories. When this has been done, this comment and the limitation above can be removed.


This section describes how to manually prepare {ubuntu} clients for registration to your {susemgr} Server and synchronize the repositories.


.Procedure: Preparing an {Ubuntu} 16.04 Client for Registration

. On the client, open the [filename]``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/suma_client_tools.list`` file, and add this line:
+
----
deb http://download.suse.de/ibs/Devel:/Galaxy:/Manager:/3.2:/Ubuntu16.04-SUSE-Manager-Tools/xUbuntu_16.04/ /
----
+
. Edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file:
+
----
sudo visudo
----
+
Grant [command]``sudo`` access to the user by adding this line to the [filename]``sudoers`` file. Replace [systemitem]``<user>`` with the name of the user that will bootstrap the client in the {webui}:
+
----
<user>   ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3
----

.Procedure: Preparing an {Ubuntu} 18.04 Client for Registration
