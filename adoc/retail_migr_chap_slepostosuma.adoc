== Migration from {slepos} 11 SP4 to {smr}

This section describes migrating from an existing {slepos}Â 11 SP4 installation, to a new {susemgr} installation.

. Install a {susemgr} server {productnumber} (with the Retail pattern).  For more information, see xref:retail_chap_install.adoc#retail.chap.install[{smr} Installation].

. On the SLEPOS Admin server export your LDAP data to an XML file with the following command:
+
----
posAdmin --export --type xml --file dumpfile.xml
----
+
Alternatively, this data can be exported branch by branch with:
+
----
posAdmin --export --type xml --file dumpfile.xml --user $branch_dn \
    --password $password
----

. Move the XML file to the {susemgr} server and convert it to YAML:
+
----
retail_migration dumpfile.xml retail.yml
----

. Review the generated YAML file and adjust it where needed. Consider ``HWTYPE`` group naming and image name and version changes in the partitioning data.
+
[NOTE]
====
{slepos} images will not be migrated. You must rebuild the images using the OS image building functionality.
For more information about building images, see xref:advanced_topics_image_management.adoc#at.images.kiwi[OS image building].
====

. Import the complete data (YAML) with:
+
----
retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yml
----
+
Alternatively, it can be imported branch by branch.


For each branch perform the following steps:

. Replace each old SLEPOS branch server with a {smr} branch server (see xref:retail_chap_install.adoc#retail.sect.install.branch[Install Branch Server]) and connect it to the {smr} server (the same procedure as for xref:retail_chap_admin.adoc#retail.sect.admin.branch_mass_config[Branch Server Mass Configuration]).

. Optionally, import a selected branch from the YAML data with:
+
----
retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yml --branch <branch_name>
----
+
If it was not done in the previous step with the complete import. (The other steps before can also be repeated optionally).

. Apply highstate on the branch server.

. Boot the terminals of the banch.

Finally, shutdown and remove the old SLEPOS Admin Server.
