{susemgr}
supports you with upgrading SLE clients to the latest version or SP (service pack).  Upgrading from SLE 12, SLE 12 SP1, or SP2 to SLE 12 SP3 or later (when available) is straight forward.
Upgrading from SLE 11 SPx to SLE 12 SP3 or later (when available) requires some additional steps, but can be automated.

[[_bp.client.migration.sle12]]
== Migrating {sls}  12 or later to version 12 SP3


Existing {sls}
 12 clients (SLE) may be upgraded to SP3 with the menu:SP Migration[]
 procedure provided by the {webui}
.
The same applies for other supported products based on {sle}
 12. 

.Synchronizing Target Channels
[WARNING]
====
Before successfully initializing the product migration, you first must make sure that the migration target channels are completely mirrored.
For the upgrade to {sle}
 12 SP3, at least the [systemitem]``SLES12-SP3-Pool``
 base channel with the [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool``
 child channel for your architecture is required.
The matching update channels such as [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates``
 and [systemitem]``SLES12-SP3-Updates``
 are recommended. 
====

.Procedure: Migrating {sle}12 Client to SP3
. Direct your browser to the {susemgr}{webui} where your client is registered, and login. 
. On the menu:Systems[All] page select your client system from the table. 
+

.Client System Details Page [[_fig_sles_old_details]]
image::sles_old_details_page.png[]

+
If there are menu:Software Updates Available[]
in the menu:System Status[]
notification install these updates first to avoid trouble during the migration process. 
. On the system's detail page (<<_fig_sles_old_details>>) select the menu:Software[] tab, then the menu:SP Migration[] tab (<<_fig_sles_old_spmigr>>). 
+

.SP Migration Page [[_fig_sles_old_spmigr]]
image::sles_old_details_spmigration.png[]
. On <<_fig_sles_old_spmigr>> you will see the installed products listed on your client. Select the wanted menu:Target Products[] (if there is more than one), which is [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3`` . 
+

.SP Migration Target [[_fig_sles_migration_target]]
image::sles_migration_target.png[]

+
Then confirm with menu:Select Channels[]
. 
+

.SP Migration Channels [[_fig_sles_migration_channels]]
image::sles_migration_channels.png[]
. On <<_fig_sles_migration_channels>>, menu:Schedule Migration[] , and on <<_fig_sles_migration_schedule>>, menu:Confirm[] . 
+

.Schedule Client System Migration [[_fig_sles_migration_schedule]]
image::sles_migration_schedule.png[]


Check the menu:System Status[]
 on the system's details when the migration is done. 

.Migrated Client System [[_fig_sles_migrated]]
image::sles_migrated.png[]


If the menu:System Status[]
 notification does not report a successful migration but lists menu:Software Updates Available[]
, install the update now and then check again. 

Finally, consider to schedule a reboot. 

[[_bp.client.migration.sle11]]
== Migrating {sle}  11 SPx to version 12 SP3

{sle}
 11 SPx clients may be auto-upgraded to version 12 SP3 by means of {yast}
auto-installation.
The same applies for other supported products based on {sle}
 11. 

.Supported Upgrade Paths
[NOTE]
====
For generally supported {sle}
upgrade paths, see the {slea}{deploy}
, chapter "`Supported Upgrade Paths to SLE 12
    SP3`"
: https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/sec_update_sle_paths.html. 

As you can see, it is especially important that you migrate the client to the latest available SP first (December 2017: Version 11 SP4). 
====


This procedure will work for "`traditionally`"
 managed systems (system type ``management``).  Using Salt it will not be available (system type ``salt``). 

During the procedure, the machine reboots and performs the system upgrade.
The process is controlled by {yast}
and {ay}
, not by plain [command]``zypper`` commands. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only perform this migration on client systems managed by {susemgr}
servers.
For upgrading the {susemgr}
server itself, see <<_bp.sp.migration>>.
This is a viable method for major version upgrades such as an upgrade from {sle}
 11 to 12. 
====


Perform the following steps: 

[[_bp.proc.client.migration.sle11.prep]]
.Procedure: System Upgrade Preparation


NOTE: 
Make sure your {susemgr}
and all the clients you want to upgrade have installed all available updates, including the {susemgr}
tools.
This is absolutely necessary, otherwise the system upgrade will fail. 
. On the {susemgr} server, create a local tree with the SLES 12 SP3 installation sources. This is needed for booting the clients into the installation or upgrade scenario. For example, download the ISO image of the DVD1 with the installation sources and mount the ISO image as [path]``/mnt/sles12-sp3`` : 
+

----
mkdir /mnt/sles12-sp3
mount -o loop`DVD1`
.iso /mnt/sles12-sp3
----
. Create an auto-installation distribution: For all distributions you want to perform a system upgrade, you need to create a SLE 12 SP3 distribution in {susemgr} . Use the following steps to create one: 
+
** In the {susemgr} Web interface, click menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Distributions] . 
** Enter a menu:Distribution Label[] for your distribution (for example, use ``summer2017``) as a label and specify the menu:Tree Path[] , which is the root directory of the {sls} 12 SP3 installation sources (for example, in this case [path]``/mnt/sles12-sp3`` ). As the menu:Base Channel[] use the update target distribution "`SLES12-SP3-Pool for x86_64`" . 
** Confirm with menu:Create Autoinstallable Distribution[] . 

+
For more information about Autoinstallation, see <<_ref.webui.systems.autoinst>>. 
. Create an activation key for your SLE 12 SP3 systems. 
+ 
In order to switch from the old SLES 11 base channel to the new SLE 12 SP3 base channel, you need an activation key.
Use the following steps to create it: 
+
** Go to menu:Systems[Activation Keys] and click menu:Create Key[] . 

[[_st.maintenance_migration.activationkey]]
** Enter a description for your key. 
** Enter a key or leave it blank to generate an automatic key. 
** If you want to limit the usage, enter your value in the menu:Usage[] text field. 
** Select the "`SLES12-SP3-Pool for x86_64`" base channel. 
** Decide about menu:Add-On System Types[] . 
** Click menu:Create Activation Key[] . 
** Click the menu:Child Channels[] tab and select the required channels. Finish with menu:Update Key[] . 
[[_st.maintenance_migration.upload]]
. Upload an {ay} profile. 
+
+
** Create an {ay} XML file according to <<_ap_sample_autoinst_system_upgrade>>. 
+ 
For more information about {ay}
, see <<_ref.webui.systems.autoinst.ay_intro>>. 
** Go to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation] and click menu:Upload Kickstart/Autoyast File[] . 
** Paste the XML content in the text area or select the file to upload. Click menu:Create[] . 
** Add `autoupgrade=1` in the menu:Kernel Options[] of the menu:Details[] tab and click menu:Update[] . 
** Switch to the menu:Variable[] tab. 
** Enter in the text field `registration_key=` and the key from <<_st.maintenance_migration.activationkey>>. 
** Click menu:Update Variables[] . 


After you have successfully finished the previous procedure, everything is prepared for an upgrade.
To upgrade a system, continue with <<_bp.proc.client.migration.sle11.upgrade>>. 
[[_bp.proc.client.migration.sle11.upgrade]]
.Procedure: Upgrading {sle}11 SPx to version 12 SP3


.Synchronizing Target Channels
WARNING: Before successfully initializing the product migration, make sure that the migration target channels are completely mirrored.
For the upgrade to {sle}
 12 SP3, at least the [systemitem]``SLES12-SP3-Pool``
 base channel with the [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool``
 child channel for your architecture is required.
The matching update channels such as [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates``
 and [systemitem]``SLES12-SP3-Updates``
 are recommended. 

For example, watch progress in [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync/sles12-sp3-pool-x86_64.log``
. 
. Go to the system via menu:Systems[] and click the name of the system. Then on the systems details page, click menu:Provisioning[Autoinstallation > Schedule] , and choose the {ay} XML profile you have uploaded in <<_bp.proc.client.migration.sle11.prep>>, <<_st.maintenance_migration.upload>>. 
. Click menu:Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish[] . 
+
+
+
+ 
Next time the machine asks the {susemgr}
server for jobs, it will receive a reinstallation job which fetches kernel and initrd and writes a new [path]``/boot/grub/menu.lst``
(containing pointers to the new kernel and initrd). 
+ 
When the machine boots, it will use the {grub}
configuration and boots the new kernel with its initrd.
No PXE boot is required for this process.
A shutdown of the machine is initiated as well, effectively 3 minutes after the job was fetched.
