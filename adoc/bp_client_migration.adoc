{productname} supports you with upgrading SLE clients.
System upgrading from SLE 12 (latest SP, service pack) to SLE 15 or a later SLE 15 SP (when available) requires some preparation steps, but can be automated.
SP migration that, for example, is upgrading from SLE 12, SLE 12 SP1, or SP2 to SLE 12 SP3 or later (when available) is fully automated and thus straight forward.


[[bp.client.migration.sle]]
== Migrating {sle} 12 SPx to version 15

{sle} 12 SPx clients may be auto-upgraded to version 15 with {yast} auto-installation.
The same applies for other supported products based on {sle} 12.

.Supported Upgrade Paths
[NOTE]
====
For generally supported {sle} upgrade paths, see  https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_sle_upgrade/data/sec_upgrade-paths_supported.html ({slea} {upgrade}, Chapter "`Supported Upgrade Paths to SLE 15`").
+
As you can see, it is important that you migrate the client to the latest available SP first.  In the case of SLE 12, this is currently SP3 (August 2018).
====


This procedure will work for "`traditionally`"  managed systems (system type ``management``).  Using Salt (system type ``salt``), for the time being, it will not be available.

During the procedure, the machine reboots and performs the system upgrade.
The process is controlled by {yast} and {ay}, not by plain [command]``zypper`` commands.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only perform this migration on client systems managed by {productname} servers.
For upgrading the {productname} server itself, see <<bp.sp.migration>>.
This is a viable method for major version upgrades such as an upgrade from {sle} 12 to 15.
====


Perform the following steps:

[[bp.proc.client.migration.sle.prep]]
.Procedure: System Upgrade Preparation

NOTE: Make sure your {productname} and all the clients you want to upgrade have installed all available updates, including the {productname} tools.
This is absolutely necessary, otherwise the system upgrade will fail.
+

. On the {productname} server, create a local tree with the SLE 15 installation sources. This is needed for booting the clients into the installation or upgrade scenario. For example, download the ISO image of the DVD1 with the installation sources and mount the ISO image as [path]``/mnt/sle15``.
+

----
mkdir /mnt/sle15
mount -o loop DVD1.iso /mnt/sle15
----
. Create an auto-installation distribution: For all distributions you want to perform a system upgrade, you need to create a SLE 15 distribution in {productname}. Use the following steps to create one:
+
** In the {productname} {webui}, click menu:Main Menu[Systems > Autoinstallation > Distributions].
** Enter a [guimenu]``Distribution Label`` for your distribution (for example, use ``autumn2018``) as a label and specify the [guimenu]``Tree Path``, which is the root directory of the {sls} 15 installation sources (for example, in this case [path]``/mnt/sle15``). As the [guimenu]``Base Channel`` use the update target distribution "`SLE-Product-SLES15-Pool for x86_64`".
** Confirm with [guimenu]``Create Autoinstallable Distribution``.
+
For more information about Autoinstallation, see <<ref.webui.systems.autoinst>>.
. Create an activation key for your SLE 15 systems.
+
In order to switch from the old SLE 12 SP3 base channel to the new SLE 15 channel, you need an activation key.
Use the following steps to create it:
+
** Go to menu:Main Menu[Systems > Activation Keys] and click [guimenu]``Create Key``.

[[st.maintenance-migration.activationkey]]
** Enter a description for your key.
** Enter a key or leave it blank to generate an automatic key.
** If you want to limit the usage, enter your value in the [guimenu]``Usage`` text field.
** Select the "`SLE-Product-SLES15-Pool for x86_64`" base channel.
** Decide about [guimenu]``Add-On System Types``.
** Click btn:[Create Activation Key].
** Click the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` tab and select the required channels. Finish with btn:[Update Key].
[[st.maintenance-migration.upload]]
. Upload an {ay} profile.
+
** Create an {ay} XML file according to <<ap-sample-autoinst-system-upgrade>>.
+
For more information about {ay}, see <<ref.webui.systems.autoinst.ay_intro>>.
** Go to menu:Main Menu[Systems > Autoinstallation] and click [guimenu]``Upload Kickstart/Autoyast File``.
** Paste the XML content in the text area or select the file to upload. Click btn:[Create].
** Add `autoupgrade=1` in the [guimenu]``Kernel Options`` of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab and click btn:[Update].
** Switch to the [guimenu]``Variable`` tab.
** Enter in the text field `registration_key=` and the key from <<st.maintenance-migration.activationkey>>.
** Click btn:[Update Variables].


After you have successfully finished the previous procedure, everything is prepared for an upgrade.
To upgrade a system, continue with <<bp.proc.client.migration.sle.upgrade>>.
[[bp.proc.client.migration.sle.upgrade]]
.Procedure: Upgrading {sle} 12 SPx to version 15

.Synchronizing Target Channels
WARNING: Before successfully initializing the product migration, make sure that the migration target channels are completely mirrored.
For the upgrade to {sle} 15, at least the [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SLES15-Pool`` base channel with the [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools15-Pool`` child channel for your architecture is required.
The matching update channels such as [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools15-Updates`` and [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SLES15-Updates`` are recommended.
// Checkit:
For example, watch progress in [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync/sles15-pool-x86_64.log``.
+

. Go to the system via menu:Main Menu[Systems] and click the name of the system. Then click menu:System Details[Provisioning > Autoinstallation > Schedule], and choose the {ay} XML profile you have uploaded in <<bp.proc.client.migration.sle.prep>>, <<st.maintenance-migration.upload>>.
. Click btn:[Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish].
+
Next time the machine asks the {productname} server for jobs, it will receive a reinstallation job which fetches kernel and initrd and writes a new [path]``/boot/grub/menu.lst`` (containing pointers to the new kernel and initrd).
+
When the machine boots, it will use the {grub} configuration and boots the new kernel with its initrd.
No PXE boot is required for this process.
A shutdown of the machine is initiated as well, effectively 3 minutes after the job was fetched.

[[bp.client.migration.sle12]]
== Migrating {sls} 12 or later to version 12 SP3


Existing {sls} 12 clients (SLE) may be upgraded to SP3 with the menu:SP Migration[] procedure provided by the {webui}.
The same applies for other supported products based on {sle} 12.

.Synchronizing Target Channels
[WARNING]
====
Before successfully initializing the product migration, you first must make sure that the migration target channels are completely mirrored.
For the upgrade to {sle}
 12 SP3, at least the [systemitem]``SLES12-SP3-Pool``
 base channel with the [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool``
 child channel for your architecture is required.
The matching update channels such as [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates``
 and [systemitem]``SLES12-SP3-Updates``
 are recommended.
====

.Procedure: Migrating {sle}12 Client to SP3
. Direct your browser to the {productname} {webui} where your client is registered, and login.
. On the menu:Systems[All] page select your client system from the table.
+

image::sles_old_details_page.png[scaledwidth=80%]

+
If there are menu:Software Updates Available[] in the menu:System Status[] notification install these updates first to avoid trouble during the migration process.

. On the system's detail page select the menu:Software[] tab, then the menu:SP Migration[] tab.
+

image::sles_old_details_spmigration.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. From this tab you will see the installed products listed on your client. Select the wanted menu:Target Products[] (if there is more than one), which is [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3`` .
+

image::sles_migration_target.png[scaledwidth=80%]

+
Then confirm with menu:Select Channels[]
.
+

image::sles_migration_channels.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Select menu:Schedule Migration[] , and then menu:Confirm[] .
+

image::sles_migration_schedule.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Check the menu:System Status[] on the system's details when the migration is done.

image::sles_migrated.png[scaledwidth=80%]

If the menu:System Status[]
 notification does not report a successful migration but lists menu:Software Updates Available[]
, install the update now and then check again.

Finally, consider to schedule a reboot.
