.Ephemeral Ports
[NOTE]
====
Anything from port 32768 on (more exactly, what you can see with [command]``cat
    /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range``) is an ephemeral port, typically used as the receiving end of a TCP connection.
So if process A opens a TCP connection to process B (for example, port 22), then A chooses an arbitrary source TCP port to match with destination port 22.
