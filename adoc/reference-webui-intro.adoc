The top bar provides access to commonly used tools and user settings.


image::topnav.png[scaledwidth=80%]


The right part of the top bar contains functionalities such as a bell icon with a counter bubble of unread notification messages, optionally, an eye icon with a context legend to the current page, quick search, links to background information, user preferences, and sign off.
On the left is the so-called breadcrumb.
The breadcrumb tells you how far you are from the root of the menu and it brings you back to any previous step.


image::home-overview-legend.png[scaledwidth=80%]


The left navigation bar is the main menu to the {productname} {webui} from where you load the {webui} pages.
If you click a the label of a menu entry you either open that page, or, if it is just a container of sub-entries, it expands this part of the menu tree without actually loading a page.
To collaps all open parts of the menu system, click the btn:[Clear Menus] button at the top of menu, right to the [guimenu]``Search page`` field.
If you click the small circle icon on the right of a menu label, the first available page of that menu entry will get loaded and displayed automatically.
Enter a search string in the [guimenu]``Search page`` field to find an entry of the menu tree.
Available menu entries depend on the roles of the user.

Only {productname} Administrators see the following navigation items:


* menu:Main Menu[Images]

* menu:Main Menu[Users]

* menu:Main Menu[Admin]


image::sidenav.png[scaledwidth=40%]

Some pages have tabs and subtabs. These tabs offer an additional layer of granularity in performing tasks for systems or users.
The following example displays the tabs and subtabs available under [guimenu]``System Details``.
Green bars underline active tabs.

[[ref.webui.intro.patch_alerts]]
== Patch Alert Icons

Throughout {productname} you will see three patch (errata) alert icons.

* image:fa-shield.svg[Security Alert,scaledwidth=1.2em]{mdash}represents a security alert.
* image:fa-bug.svg[Bug Fix Alert,scaledwidth=1.6em]{mdash}represents a bug fix alert.
* image:spacewalk-icon-enhancement.svg[Enhancement Alert,scaledwidth=1.4em]{mdash}represents an enhancement alert.


On the menu:Main Menu[Home > Overview] page, in the [guimenu]``Relevant Security Patches`` section click the patch advisory to view details about the patch or click the number of affected systems to see which systems are affected by the patch alert.
Both links take you to tabs of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page.
If all patches are installed, there is just a [guimenu]``View All Patches`` link to open the menu:Main Menu[Patches] page.
Refer to

<<s3-sm-errata-details>>
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<reference-webui-patches.adoc#s3-sm-errata-details,Patch details>>
endif::[]
for more information.



[[ref.webui.intro.quick_search]]
== Search

In the top bar, {productname} offers a search functionality for Packages, Patches (Errata), Documentation, and Systems.
To use the search, click the magnifier, then select the search item (choose from [guimenu]``Systems``, [guimenu]``Packages``, [guimenu]``Documentation``, and [guimenu]``Patches``) and type a string to look for a name match.
Click the btn:[Search] button.
Your results appear at the bottom of the page.


image::top_search.png[scaledwidth=40%]


If you misspell a word during your search query, the {productname} search engine performs approximate string (or fuzzy string) matching, returning results that may be similar in spelling to your misspelled queries.

For example, if you want to search for a certain development system called `test-1.example.com` that is registered with {productname}, but you misspell your query ``tset``, the `test-1.example.com` system still appears in the search results.

[NOTE]
====
If you add a distribution or register a system with a {productname} server, it may take several minutes for it to be indexed and appear in search results.

[[ref.webui.intro.systems_selected]]
== Systems Selected


On the menu:Main Menu[Systems > Overview] page, if you mark the check box next to a system, the [guimenu]``system selected`` number on the right area of the top bar increases.
This number keeps track of the systems you have selected for use in the System Set Manager (SSM); for more information, see to
ifndef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<ref.webui.systems.ssm>>.
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<reference-webui-systems.adoc#ref.webui.systems.ssm, Systems Set Manager>>.
endif::[]

At any time, it identifies the number of selected systems and provides the means to work (simultaneously) with an entire selection.
Clicking the the rubber symbol ([guimenu]``Clear``) deselects all systems, while clicking the [guimenu]``system selected`` string ([guimenu]``Manage``) launches the System Set Manager with your selected systems in place.

These systems can be selected in a number of ways.
Only systems with at least a Management system role are eligible for selection.
On all system and system group lists, a check boxes exist for this purpose.
Each time you select a check box next to the systems or groups the [guimenu]``systems selected`` counter at the top of the page changes to reflect the new number of systems ready for use in the System Set Manager.



[[ref.webui.intro.list_nav]]
== Lists

The information within most categories is presented in the form of lists.
These lists have some common features for navigation.
For instance, you can set the number of [guimenu]``items per page`` and navigate through virtually all lists by clicking the back and next arrows above and below the right side of the table.
Some lists also offer the option to retrieve items alphabetically by clicking numbers or letters from the [guimenu]``Alphabetical Index`` above the table.

.Performing Large List Operations
[NOTE]
====
Performing operations on large lists (such as removing RPM packages from the database with the {productname} {webui}) may take some time and the system may become unresponsive or signal "`Internal Server Error 500`".
Nevertheless, the command will succeed in the background if you wait long enough.
