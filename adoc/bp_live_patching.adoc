[[live.patching.intro]]
== Introduction


Under normal circumstances a system needs to be rebooted after a kernel update.
SLE Live Patching allows you skipping the reboot by applying a subset of Linux kernel releases injected via kGraft live patching technology.

In the following sections you will learn how to use SLE Live Patching to avoid the typical reboot requirement after updating a system kernel.

For in depth information covering kGraft use, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_sle_admin/book_sle_admin.html#cha.kgraft.

[[live.patching.req]]
== Initial Setup Requirements


To work with SLE Live Patching the following expectations are assumed:

* {productname} fully updated.
* At least 1 Salt Minion running SLES 12 SP1 or later and registered with {productname} .
* The matching SLES 12 SPx channels including the SLE Live Patching child channel fully synced.


[[live.patching.setup]]
== Live Patching Setup


. Subscribe all systems to be managed via live patching to your fully synced live patching child channels within your systems base channel by browsing to menu:Software[Software Channels] . Select both live patching channels and change subscription.
+
NOTE: When subscribing to a channel that contains a product, the product package will automatically be installed on traditionaly registered systems and added to the package state on Salt managed systems.
For Salt managed systems please apply the highstate to push these changes to your systems.
+


+


image::enable_live_patching_channels.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Use the search field listed under menu:Software[Packages > Install] to install the latest [path]``kgraft`` package to all systems to be managed via live patching.
+


image::enable_live_patching_kgraft_install.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Apply the highstate to enable live patching:
+


image::enable_live_patching_apply_highstate.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Once the highstate has been applied on Salt systems or the package has been installed on traditional systems browse to the systems details page for confirmation that live patching has been enabled. You can check the live patching state listed under the menu:System Info[Kernel] table field:
+

[[live.patching.clones]]
== Cloning Channels


It is considered best practice to clone a vendor channel that will be modified into a new channel with one of the following prefix names: ``dev``, ``testing``, and ``prod``.
In the following procedure you will clone the default vendor channel into a new channel named [systemitem]``dev-sles12-sp3-pool-x86_64``
 using the command line.
[[proc.live.patching.clones]]

. Open a terminal and as root enter:
+

----
# spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --list-channels
Spacewalk Username: admin
Spacewalk Password:
Channel tree:

 1. sles{sles-version}-sp{sp-ver}-pool-x86_64
      \__ sle-live-patching{sles-version}-pool-x86_64-sp{sp-ver}\__ sle-live-patching{sles-version}-updates-x86_64-sp{sp-ver}\__ sle-manager-tools{sles-version}-pool-x86_64-sp{sp-ver}\__ sle-manager-tools{sles-version}-updates-x86_64-sp{sp-ver}\__ sles{sles-version}-sp{sp-ver}-updates-x86_64
----
. Now use the _--init_ argument to automatically create a new development clone of the original vendor channel:
+

----
spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --init -c sles{sles-version}-sp{sp-ver}-pool-x86_64
----


[[live.patching.kernel]]
== Removing Non-live Kernel Patches from the Cloned Channels


In the following procedure you will remove all kernel patch updates located in the dev-sles{sles-version}
-sp{sp-ver}
-updates-x86_64 channel that require a reboot.
You created dev-sles{sles-version}
-sp{sp-ver}
-updates-x86_64 during <<proc.live.patching.clones>>.


. Check the current kernel version in use on your client:
+

----
# uname -r
3.12.62-60.64.8-default
----
. From the {productname} {webui} select menu:Software[Manage Software Channels > Overview > dev-sles12-sp3-updates-x86_64 > Patches > List/Remove] . Type `kernel` in the search field. Find the kernel version that matches the kernel in use on your minion.
. Remove all kernel update versions that are later than the current kernel.
. Your channel is now ready to promote for testing SLE Live Patching.


[[live.patching.channel-promo]]
== Promoting Channels


The following procedure will guide you through promoting and cloning a development channel to a testing channel.
You will change the subscription from the dev repositories on your client to the new testing channel repositories.
You will also add the SLE Live Patching child channels to your client.


. Promote and clone the `dev-sles{sles-version} -sp{sp-ver} -pool-x86_64` to a new testing channel:
+

----
{prompt.root}spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle -promote -c dev-sles{sles-version}-sp{sp-ver}-pool-x86_64
----
. From the {productname} {webui} under the menu:Systems[] tab select your client system to view the menu:System Details[] page. Select menu:Software[Software Channels] . From the Software Channels page you can edit which channels a system is subscribed to. Select the new base software channel, in this case it should be [systemitem]``test-sles12-sp3-pool-x86_64`` . Click the menu:Confirm[] button to switch the Base Software Channel and finalize it by clicking the menu:Modify Base Software Channel[] button.
. From the menu:Software Channels[] page select and add both SLE Live Patching child channels by clicking the menu:Change Subscriptions[] button.


[[live.patching.applying]]
== Applying Live Patches to a Kernel


The following procedure will guide you through selecting and viewing available CVE Patches (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) then applying these kernel updates using the new SLE Live Patching feature.


. Select your SLES {sles-version} SP{sp-ver} minion from the menu:Systems[] page to view its menu:System Details[] . Once you have added the SLES {sles-version} SP{sp-ver} Updates child channel to your client, you should see several `Critical` software updates available. Click on `Critical` to see a list of available patches. Select any of these patches listed with the following synopsis: __Important: Security update for the Linux kernel__. All fixed security bugs will be listed along with their number. For example:(CVE-2016-8666)
+
.Reboot Icon
IMPORTANT: Normal or non-live kernel patches always require a reboot.
In {productname} these are represented by a `Reboot Required` icon located next to the `Security` shield icon.
+

. You can search for individual CVE's by selecting the menu:Audit[] tab from the navigation menu. Try searching for ``CVE-2016-8666``. You will see that the patch is available in the vendor update channel and the systems it applies to will be listed.


.CVE Availability
[IMPORTANT]
====
Not all security issues can be fixed by applying a live patch.
Some security issues can only be fixed by applying a full kernel update and will required a reboot.
The assigned CVE numbers for these issues are not included in live patches.
A CVE audit will display this requirement.
