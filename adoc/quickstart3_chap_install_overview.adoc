[[quickstart.sect.introduction]]
== Introduction to {productname}

{productname} is a solution for organizations that require absolute control over maintenance and package deployment on their servers.
It lets you manage large sets of Linux systems and keep them up to date, with automated software management, asset management, and system provisioning.
{productname} allows you to maintain a high level of security while effectively managing system life-cycle requirements.

{productname} uses _Salt_ to provide event-driven configuration and management control.
The Salt-master orchestrates thousands of Salt-minions ({productname} Clients) using remote execution.

{productname} is fully compatible with Red Hat Satellite Server and offers seamless management of both {sle} and {rhel} client systems.

{productname} can be integrated with your network infrastructure in multiple ways.
This book will guide you through an initial proof-of-concept setup, using these steps:

. Install an operating system (either JeOS or {slsa}) for use with {productname}
. Install {productname} Server
. Register {productname} with {scc}
. Perform initial setup of your {productname} Server
. Register a traditional client
. Register a Salt minion



[[quickstart.sect.prereq]]
== Prerequisites for Installation

Before you begin your installation, ensure you have fulfilled these prerequisites:

* Current {scc} organization credentials
* Access to installation media for your chosen operating system
* Your environment meets the hardware and networking requirements
* You understand the supported client operating systems


This section contains more information on each of these prerequisites.

[NOTE]
====
{productname} {productnumber} is based on {slsa} {sles-version} {sp-version} as the host operating system.
====


[[quickstart.sect.prereq.scc]]
=== Obtaining your SUSE Customer Center Credentials

You will need to create an account with {scc} before you install {sls} and {productname}.
To obtain your {scc} credentials:

[[creating.scc.account.mgr]]
.Procedure: Obtaining Your SCC Organization Credentials
. Open a browser and direct it to https://scc.suse.com/login.
. If you have not done so, create an account now.
. Log in to your new SCC account.
. Under the btn:[Management tools] widget select btn:[Manage Users].
. Click the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Record your login information for use during {productname} setup.



[[quickstart.sect.prereq.installmedia]]
=== Obtaining Installation Media

This book describes installation methods for both {jeos} and {sls}.
The {jeos} image provides the quickest installation and setup, and is suitable for a test or proof of concept installation.
Alternatively, {sls} provides a more robust installation, which requires a larger initial download.
Choose your preferred operating system based on the type of environment you want to install, and the amount of bandwidth and time you have available.

You can find installation images for {jeos} and {slsa} in your {scc} account.
Log in, then navigate to the URL for your chosen operating system:

* https://www.suse.com/products/server/jeos/[JeOS - Media Download]
* https://www.suse.com/products/server/download/[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server - Media Download]

[[quickstart.sect.prereq.network]]
=== Network Requirements

This section details the networking and port requirements for {productname}.


Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):: The {productname} server must resolve its FQDN correctly or cookies will not work properly on the WebUI.
For more information about configuring the hostname and DNS, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/sec_basicnet_yast.html#sec_basicnet_yast_change_host[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation - Configuring Host Name and DNS]

Hostname and IP Address:: To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server.
For more information about setting up a DNS server, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/cha_dns.html[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation - The Domain Name System]

Using a Proxy When Installing from {sle} Media:: If you are on an internal network and do not have access to {scc}, you can set up and use a proxy during installation.
For more information about configuring a proxy for access to {scc} during a {sle} installation, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sled-12/singlehtml/book_sle_deployment/book_sle_deployment.html#sec.i.yast2.start.parameters.proxy[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation -  Using a Proxy During Installation]


.Naming Your Server
[IMPORTANT]
====
The hostname of {productname} must not contain uppercase letters as this may cause _jabberd_ to fail.
Choose the hostname of your {productname} server carefully.
Although changing the server name is possible, it is a complex process and unsupported.
====


In a production environment, {productname} server and its clients should always use a firewall.
This table gives an overview of required ports, to be used when you are setting up your firewall rules.
