[[quickstart.sect.introduction]]
== What is {productname}?

{productname} lets you manage large sets of Linux systems and keep them up to date.
It provides automated software management, asset management, and system provisioning.
{productname} is a solution for organizations requiring absolute control of maintenance and package deployment on their servers.
{productname} allows administrators to maintain a high level of security while facilitating and advancing an organizations system life-cycle requirements.

Salt::
The inclusion of _Salt_ in {productname} provides powerful event-driven configuration and management capabilities for fine grained control of any modern infrastructure.

Salt-master::
{productname} takes a commanding role as a Salt-master capable of orchestrating thousands of Salt-minions ({productname} Clients) via remote execution.

Distribution Management::
{productname} is fully compatible with Red Hat Satellite Server and offers seamless management of both {sle} and {rhel} client systems.

[[quickstart.sect.bird.eye.view]]
== Overview

{productname} may be integrated within your network infrastructure in multiple ways.
In this guide you will perform the following steps for an initial test setup.

// TODO: This section is outdated, bring it up-to-date
* Install {sls} with {productname} as an extension
* Setup {productname} Server via YaST
* Register {productname} with SCC (SUSE Customer Center)
* Synchronize a repository channel for use with both traditional clients and Salt minions
* Create an authentication key to act as an ID for the synced repository channel
* Add the new authentication key to a bootstrap template script and connect a traditional client
* Register a Salt minion with {productname} (salt-master) and assign it a channel with an authentication key

[[quickstart.sect.prerequisites.install]]
== Prerequisites for Installation

This guide requires that you have created an account with SCC ({scc}).
During installation of both {sls} ({slsa}) and {productname}, SCC credentials will be requested and you must enter them to receive the latest packages and updates.
The following procedure will guide you through obtaining your SCC _Organizational Credentials_.

[[creating.scc.account.mgr]]
.Procedure: Obtaining Your SCC Organization Credentials
. Open a browser and direct it to https://scc.suse.com/login.
. If you have not done so, create an account now.
. Log in to your new SCC account.
. Under the btn:[Management tools] widget select btn:[Manage Users].
. Click the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Keep this information handy during {productname} setup.

== Obtaining Installation Media

After logging into your SCC account, you can find the installation images provided at the following addresses.

Select one and continue reading:

* Just Enough Operating System (JeOS) 290 MB  https://www.suse.com/products/server/jeos/[JeOS - Media Download]
* {slsa} DVD image 3 GB https://www.suse.com/products/server/download/[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server - Media Download]

.Just Enough Operating System (JeOS) vs. Full Media Image
[NOTE]
====
The {slsa} JeOS image provides the quickest route for setup of a test environment.
The JeOS image total size is about 290 MB.
The alternative would be the 3 GB {slsa} DVD image.
Both installation media are appropriate, but depend upon available bandwidth or your application needs.
Both methods of installation will be covered in this guide.

== Base Host Operating System

{productname} {productnumber} is based on {slsa} {sles-version} {sp-version} as the host operating system.

[[mgr.supported.client.systems]]
== Supported Client Systems

Clients with the following operating systems are supported for registration with {productname}.
If you plan on using the new Salt features, ensure your clients are supported.

.Supported Versions and SP Levels
[NOTE]
====
Client operating system versions and SP levels must be under general support (normal or LTSS) to be supported with {productname}.
For details on supported product versions, see https://www.suse.com/lifecycle.

[[mgr.additional.requirements]]
== Network Requirements


To successfully complete this guide some network requirements must be met.
The following section will walk you through these requirements.


Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):: The {productname} server must resolve its FQDN correctly or cookies will not work properly on the WebUI.

* https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/sec_basicnet_yast.html#sec_basicnet_yast_change_host[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation - Configuring Host Name and DNS]

Hostname and IP Address:: To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working Domain Name System (DNS) server.
This guide assumes the required infrastructure exists within your environment.
For more information on setting up a (DNS) server see:


* https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/cha_dns.html[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation - The Domain Name System]

Using a Proxy When Installing from {sle} Media:: If you are on an internal network and do not have access to {scc}, you can setup and use a proxy during a {sle} installation.
For more information on configuring a proxy for access to {scc} during a {sle} installation see:

* https://www.suse.com/documentation/sled-12/singlehtml/book_sle_deployment/book_sle_deployment.html#sec.i.yast2.start.parameters.proxy[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation -  Using a Proxy During Installation]


.Naming Your Server
[IMPORTANT]
====
The hostname of {productname} must not contain uppercase letters as this may cause _jabberd_ to fail.
Choose the hostname of your {productname} server carefully.
Although changing the server name is possible, it is a complex process and unsupported.
====

== Firewall Port Rules

In a production environment {productname} server and its clients should always utilize firewall rules.
The following table provides an overview of required ports.

Traditional client systems connect to {productname} via port 443.
In addition, enabling push actions from {productname} to client systems, requires inbound connections on port 5222.
If {productname} will also push to a {productname} proxy, you must allow inbound connections on port 5269.

[[tab.install.ports.server1]]
.Required Ports on {productname} Server
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Port | Direction        | Reason
| 67   | Inbound          | Required when configured as a DHCP server for systems requesting IP addresses
| 69   | Inbound          | Used when configured as a PXE server and allows installation and re-installation of PXE-boot enabled systems
| 80   | Outbound         | Used to contact {scc}
| 443  | Inbound          | All WebUI, traditional client, and proxy server requests and {productname} uses this port for {scc} inbound traffic
| 443  | Outbound         | {productname} uses this port to reach {scc} unless running in disconnected mode with RMT or SMT
| 4505 | Inbound          | Required by the Salt-master to accept communication requests via TCP from minions
| 4506 | Inbound          | Required by the Salt-master to accept communication requests via TCP from minions
| 5222 | Inbound          | When you wish to push actions to clients this port is required by the _osad_ daemon running on the client systems
| 5269 | Inbound/Outbound | Needed if you push actions to or via a {susemgrproxy}
|      | Outbound         | Squid HTTP proxy for outgoing connections. It could be any port you configure
