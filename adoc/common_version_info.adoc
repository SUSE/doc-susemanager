.{productname} Version Information
====
In this manual if not other specified, {productname} version {productnumber} is assumed and this version is required if a feature is discussed.
{productname} {productnumber} and {productname} {productnumber} Proxy were originally released as a SLES 12 SP3 extension.
With the next maintenance update (December 2018),
{productname} {productnumber} and {productname} {productnumber} Proxy will be based on SLES 12 SP4 and support SLE 12 SP4 clients officially.
In the following sections and chapters, it is highly recommended to use SLE 12 SP4 instead of SP3.
Whenever features of the {productname} {productnumber} host operating system are documented and not other specified version 12 SP4 is assumed.
