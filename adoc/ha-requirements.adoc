[#prepare-the-shared-storage-node]
== Prepare a Storage Node

You will setup the storage node to use ISCSI.
Configure a single storage server on KVM with the following software installed:

* *SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3* _(with all available online updates)_

* *SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 12 SP3* _(with all available online updates)_
