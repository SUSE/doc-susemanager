* The branch server requires a reliable WAN connection, to reach the {susemgr} server
* If you are using a shared network, ensure that DHCP requests are filtered before reaching the rest of your shared network
* If you are using a dedicated network, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one connected to the WAN with reachable {susemgr} server, and one connected to the internal branch LAN.
* Terminals require a LAN connection to the branch server network.



[[retail.sect.install.install]]
== Installation

{smr} can be installed in various ways depending on individual needs.
We recommend these steps:

. Install the {susemgr} server
. Configure the {susemgr} server
. Install the {smr} pattern on the {susemgr} server
. Install the build host and register it to {susemgr}
. Configure the build host
. Create required system group

Branch server installation steps:

. Install the branch server and register it to {susemgr}
. Assign and configure branch server formulas
. Synchronize images to the servers

Each procedure is detailed in this section.



=== Install the {susemgr} server

For instructions to install {susemgr}, see the https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/3.2/susemanager-getting-started/html/book.suma.getting-started/quickstart.chapt.overview.requirements.html#quickstart.sect.introduction

[WARNING]
.Do Not Enable PXE Boot
====
Do not enable PXE boot functionality on the {susemgrproxy} during initial setup.
This functionality will be installed later, after the initial setup.
====



[[retail.sect.install.install.config]]
=== Configure the {susemgr} server

It is important that all required SUSE channels are available on your system and synchronized in order for {smr} to operate correctly.
For more information on channel management, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/3.2/susemanager-advanced-topics/html/book.suma.advanced.topics/suse.mgr.command.line.tools.html#syncing.suse.mgr.repositories.scc

Channels required for {smr} functionality:
----
- SLES 12 SP3 (SP4 in the future) as a base
  - SLES Pool
    - SLES Update
- SUSE Manager 3.2 Tools
  - SUSE Manager 3.2 Tools Pool
    - SUSE Manager 3.2 Tools Update
- SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy
  - SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy Pool
    - SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy Update
- SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy for Retail
  - SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy for Retail Pool
    - SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy for Retail Update
----

After you have synchronized the required SUSE channels, create channels for any custom software.
Channels are used to provide custom software for OS image building.
For more information on software channels, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/3.2/susemanager-reference/html/book.suma.reference.manual/ref.webui.channels.html




=== Install the {smr} pattern on the {susemgr} server

.Procedure: Installing the {smr} pattern on the {susemgr} server
. Install the [package]``SUSE Manager for Retail`` pattern on the {susemgr} server:
+
----
zypper in -t pattern suma_retail
----

. Check that you have these packages installed and available, after installing {susemgr} and {smr} pattern:

* bind-formula
* branch-network-formula
* dhcpd-formula
* image-sync-formula
* pxe-formula
* saltboot-formula
* susemanager-retail-tools
* tftpd-formula
* vsftpd-formula
+
Install any missing packages with [command]``zypper``:
+
----
zypper install package_name
----
. Synchronize the salt filesystem and salt modules:
+
----
salt-run fileserver.update
salt '*' saltutil.sync_all
----
. Restart the salt master service to pick up the changes:
+
----
Restart salt master service now.

systemctl restart salt-master
----

For more information about formulas, see xref:retail_chap_formulas.adoc#retail.chap.formulas[Formulas].

=== Install the build host and register it to {susemgr}

Your build host should be a Salt minion, running {sls}{nbsp}12 SP3.
For instructions to install Salt minion see https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/3.2/susemanager-getting-started/html/book.suma.getting-started/preparing.and.registering.clients.html

[WARNING]
====
The build host must be a Salt minion.
Do not install the build host as a traditionally managed client.
====



=== Configure the build host

The build host must be set as an OS Image build host in the {susemgr} {webui}, and highstate applied.

.Procedure: Configuring the build host

. In the {susemgr} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Overview].
Locate the system to be made a build host, and click on its name.
. In the [guimenu]``System Properties`` window, click btn:[Edit These Properties].
. In the [guimenu]``Edit System Details`` window, ensure the [guimenu]``OS Image Build Host`` option is checked, and click btn:[Update Properties] to save your changes.
. Select the [guimenu]``States`` tab, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Highstate`` window.
. In the [guimenu]``States`` tab, click btn:[Apply Highstate].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Check that the build host has these packages installed after you have run Highstate:

- kiwi
- kiwi-desc-saltboot

If any package is missing, make sure the ``SUSE Manager 3.2 Tools`` repository is available on the build host and install any missing packages manually using ``zypper install``.
====



=== Create required system groups

{smr} requires system groups for terminals and servers.
Manually create these system groups during installation:

* [systemitem]``TERMINALS``
* [systemitem]``SERVERS``

Additionally, you will need to create a system group for each branch server, and each terminal hardware type in your environment.

You can create system groups using the {susemgr} {webui}.
Navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and click on btn:[Create System Group].

For more information about system groups, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/3.2/susemanager-reference/html/book.suma.reference.manual/ref.webui.systems.systems.html#ref.webui.systems.systemgroups


[[retail.sect.install.branch]]
=== Install the branch server and register it to {susemgr}

Your branch server should be installed as a default Salt-based client ("minion"), running {susemgrproxy}Â 3.2.

[WARNING]
====
Do not install the branch server as a traditionally managed client.
====

For instructions to install Salt-based proxy minions and register them to {susemgr}, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/3.2/susemanager-advanced-topics/html/book.suma.advanced.topics/advanced.topics.proxy.quickstart.html

The activation key should have the following channels:

----
- SLES 12 SP3 (SP4 in the future) as a base
  - SLES Pool
    - SLES Update
- SUSE Manager 3.2 Tools
  - SUSE Manager 3.2 Tools Pool
    - SUSE Manager 3.2 Tools Update
- SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy
  - SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy Pool
    - SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy Update
- SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy for Retail
  - SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy for Retail Pool
    - SUSE Manager 3.2 Proxy for Retail Update
----


For mass deployments, see xref:retail_chap_admin.adoc#retail.sect.admin.branch_mass_config[Branch Server Mass Configuration].


When you are installing the branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks.
If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server.

=== Assign and configure branch server formulas

Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology, and know the Salt ID of the branch server.

The branch server can be configured automatically using the [command]``retail_branch_init`` command, as shown in this section.
If you prefer to manually configure the branch server, you can do so using formulas.
For more information about formulas, see xref:retail_chap_formulas.adoc#retail.chap.formulas[Formulas].

.Procedure: Configuring branch server formulas using helper script

. Branch server configuration is performed using the [command]``retail_branch_init`` command:
+
----
retail_branch_init <branch_server_salt_id>
----
+
This command will configure branch server formulas with recommended values. You can use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command for additional options.
. Verify that your changes have been configured correctly by checking the {susemgr} {webui} branch server system formulas.
. Apply highstate on the branch server.
You can do this through the {webui}, or by running this command:
+
----
salt <branch_server_salt_id> state.apply
----



=== Synchronize images to the servers

The OS image you use on the {susemgr} server must be synchronized for use on the branch server.
You can do this with the Salt [command]``image-sync`` tool.

.Procedure: Synchronize images with branch server

. On the branch server, run this command:
+
----
salt <branch_server_salt_id> state.apply image-sync
----
. The image details will be transferred to [path]``/srv/saltboot`` on the branch server.
