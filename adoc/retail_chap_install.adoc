[[retail.sect.running.requirements]]
== Requirements

Before you install {smr}, ensure your environment meets the minimum requirements:


[IMPORTANT]
====
{smr} is only supported on {x86_64} architecture.
====


.Network Requirements

* The central server requires a reliable and fast WAN connection
* The Branch server requires a reliable WAN connection in order to reach the central server
* If you are using a shared network, ensure that your router and firewall can filter DHCP requests between the shared network annd the WAN
* If you are using a dedicated network, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one connected to the WAN with reachable central server, and one connected to the internal branch LAN.
* Terminals require a LAN connection to the branch server network.



[[retail.sect.running.install]]
== Installation


Most {smr} installations require several steps:

. Install and configure the central server
. Install the {smr} pattern on the central server
. Install and configure the build host
. Register the build host to {susemgr}
. Set the build host as an OS Image build host in the {susemgr} {webui}, and apply highstate
. Install and configure the branch server
. Register the branch server to {susemgr}
. Assign and configure branch server formulas

Each procedure is detailed in this section.

.Procedure: Install and configure the central server
. Refer to <<quickstart.chapt.overview.requirements>> how to install underlying {susemgr}.
. {smr} formulas consists of several packages that are available from {susemgr} media. {smr} formula packages:
* bind-formula
* branch-network-formula
* dhcpd-formula
* image-sync-formula
* pxe-formula
* tftp-formula
* vsftpd-formula

. If any package is missing, install missing package using zypper call
+
----
zypper install $package_name
----
+
and synchronize salt filesystem and salt modules
+
----
salt-run fileserver.update
salt '*' saltutil.sync_all
----
. When all packages are present on central {susemgr} server saltboot runner needs to be manually configured by providing Salt API access to {susemgr} system.
+
----
/etc/salt/master.d/spacewalk.conf
spacewalk:
    localhost:
        username: $administration_user
        password: $administration_password
----
. In order to avoid putting overall {susemgr} administration credentials to the configuration files, any administration account for given organization is sufficient.
. To finish configuration of central {susemgr} server, restart of salt master service is required.
+
----
Restart salt master service now.

systemctl restart salt-master

.Procedure: Set the build host as an OS Image build host in the {susemgr} {webui}, and apply highstate
. Standard OS Image building feature of {susemgr} is used. Images are built from customized Kiwi templates, as a starting point see SUSE provided OS Image templates.
. Adapt these templates to contain all required software, branding, configurations. Refer to Kiwi Image System documentation for details how to work with Kiwi templates.
. If you are creating Kiwi template from scratch, please make sure image/preferences/type elements attribute boot is set to saltboot/suse-SLES12
. Once the image is build, it will be automatically transferred to {susemgr} server

[[retail.sect.running.setup]]
== Initial setup


To get started with {smr} after installation, you need to perform these steps:

. Build the image that will be deployed on terminals
. Synchronize images from the central server to the branch servers
. Boot terminals

Each procedure is detailed in this section.
