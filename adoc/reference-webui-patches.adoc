The menu:Main Menu[Patches] menu from the left bar helps tracking the availability and application of patches to your managed systems.

The menu:Main Menu[Patches > Patches] page displays all or relevant patches for at least one of your managed systems that have not been applied yet.

.Receiving Patches for Your System
[NOTE]
====
To receive an e-mail when patches are issued for your system, go to menu:Main Menu[Home > Your Preferences] and select [guimenu]``Receive email notifications``.
====

{suse} distinguishes three types of patches: security updates, bug fix updates, and enhancement updates.
Each patch consists of a summary of the problem and solution, including the RPM packages fixing the problem.

Icons are used to identify the three types:

* image:fa-shield.svg[Security Alert,scaledwidth=1.2em] -- Security Updates available, _strongly_ recommended
* image:fa-bug.svg[Bug Fix Alert,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- Bug Fix Updates available, recommended
* image:spacewalk-icon-enhancement.svg[Enhancement Alert,scaledwidth=1.4em] -- Enhancement Updates available, optional


A summary of each patch is provided in list form displaying its type, advisory ID, synopsis (with the severity as a textual prefix in case of security updates, such as "`critical`", "`important`", "`moderate`", or "`low`"), number of affected systems in your network, and date updated.

In addition, you may view patches by product line at the following location: http://download.suse.com/patch/psdb/.
For more information on security updates, see https://www.suse.com/support/security/.



[[ref.webui.patches.relevant]]
== Relevant

The [guimenu]``Relevant`` patches page displays a customized list of patches applying to your registered systems.


image::patches_relevant_patches.png[scaledwidth=80%]


Clicking an [guimenu]``Advisory`` ID of a patch takes you to the [guimenu]``Details`` page of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page.
Clicking the number of associated systems takes you to the [guimenu]``Affected Systems`` page of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page.
Refer to <<s3-sm-errata-details>> for more information.



[[ref.webui.patches.all]]
== All

The [guimenu]``All`` patches page displays a list of all patches released by {suse}, irrelevant of whether they apply to your registered systems or not.


image::patches_all_patches.png[scaledwidth=80%]


Like in the [guimenu]``Relevant Patches`` page, clicking either [guimenu]``Advisory`` or the number of systems affected takes you to related tabs of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page.
Refer to <<s3-sm-errata-details>> for more information.



[[s3-sm-apply-errata]]
=== Applying Patches

Patches include a list of updated packages.
To apply patches to a system, the system must be entitled.

Apply all applicable patches to a system by clicking menu:Main Menu[Systems > Systems].
Click the name of an entitled system.
Then open the menu:System Details[Software > Patches] subtab.
When the relevant patch list appears, click btn:[Select All] then btn:[Apply Patches].
Only patches not scheduled, scheduled but failed, or canceled patches are listed.
Pending updates are excluded.

In addition, users with appropriate roles can apply patches using two other methods:

* To apply a specific patch to one or more systems, locate it in the patch list and click the number of systems affected, which takes you to the [guimenu]``Affected Systems`` page of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page. Select the individual systems to be updated and click the btn:[Apply Patches] button. Double-check the systems to be updated on the confirmation page, then click the btn:[Confirm] button.
* To apply more than one patch to one or more systems, select the systems from the menu:Main Menu[Systems > Systems] list. Click the menu:Main Menu[Systems > System Set Manager > Overview], then click the [guimenu]``Systems`` tab. After ensuring the appropriate systems are selected, click the [guimenu]``Patches`` tab, select the patches to apply, and click the btn:[Apply Patches] button. Schedule a date and time for the patch to be applied. Default is the current date. Click the btn:[Confirm] button. You can follow the progress of the patch application via the [guimenu]``Pending Actions`` list. Refer to <<ref.webui.schedule>> for more details.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use scheduled package installation, the packages or patches are installed via the {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``). You must enable the {productname} daemon on your systems.
For more information about the {productname} daemon, see <<bp.contact.methods.rhnsd>>.
====


The following rules apply to patches:

* Each package is a member of one or more channels. If a selected system is not subscribed to a channel containing the package, the update will not be installed on that system.
* If a newer version of the package is already installed on the system, the update will not be installed.
* If an older version of the package is installed, the package will be upgraded.



[[s3-sm-errata-details]]
=== Patch Details

If you click the advisory of a patch in the [guimenu]``Relevant`` or [guimenu]``All`` pages, its [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page appears.
This page is further divided into the following tabs:



[[s4-sm-errata-details-details]]
==== menu:Patch Details[Details]

This subtab displays the patch report issued by {suse}.
It provides a synopsis of the patch first (with the severity as a textual prefix in case of security updates, such as "`critical`", "`important`", "`moderate`", or "`low`"), issue date, and any update dates.
This is followed by a description of the patch and the steps required to resolve the issue.

Below the [guimenu]``Affected Channels`` label, all channels that contain the affected package are listed.
Clicking a channel name displays the [guimenu]``Packages`` subtab of the [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page for that channel.
Refer to <<s3-sm-channel-details>> for more information.

Security updates list the specific vulnerability as tracked by http://cve.mitre.org.
This information is listed below the [guimenu]``CVEs`` label.

OVAL is an open vulnerability and assessment language promoted by Mitre, http://oval.mitre.org.
Clicking the link below the [guimenu]``Oval`` label downloads this information to your system.
More useful are the {suse} Update Advisories at https://www.suse.com/support/update/.



[[s4-sm-errata-details-packages]]
==== menu:Patch Details[Packages]

This page provides links to each of the updated RPMs by channel.
Clicking the name of a package displays its [guimenu]``Package Details`` page.



[[s4-sm-errata-details-systems]]
==== menu:Patch Details[Affected Systems]

This page lists systems affected by the patches.
You can apply updates here.
(See <<s3-sm-apply-errata>>.) Clicking the name of a system takes you to its [guimenu]``System Details`` page.
Refer to <<s3-sm-system-details>> for more information.

To determine whether an update has been scheduled, refer to the [guimenu]``Status`` column in the affected systems table.
Possible values are: N/A, Pending, Picked Up, Completed, and Failed.
This column identifies only the last action related to a patch.
For example, if an action fails and you reschedule it, this column shows the status of the patch as pending with no mention of the previous failure.
Clicking a status other than [guimenu]``N/A`` takes you to the [guimenu]``Action Details`` page.
This column corresponds to one on the [guimenu]``Patch`` tab of the [guimenu]``System Details`` page.



[[ref.webui.patches.search]]
== Advanced Search

The menu:Main Menu[Patches > Advanced Search] page allows you to search through patches by specific criteria.


image::patches_advanced_search_patches.png[scaledwidth=80%]


* [guimenu]``All Fields`` -- Search patches by synopsis, description, topic, or solution.
* [guimenu]``Patch Advisory`` -- The name or the label of the patch.
+
* [guimenu]``Package Name`` -- Search particular packages by name:
+

----
kernel
----
+
Results will be grouped by advisory.
For example, searching for 'kernel' returns all package names containing the string ``kernel``, grouped by advisory.
* [guimenu]``CVE`` -- The name assigned to the security advisory by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project at http://cve.mitre.org. For example:
+

----
CVE-2006-4535
----


To filter patch search results, check or uncheck the boxes next to the type of advisory:

* Bug Fix Advisory -- Patches that fix issues reported by users or discovered during development or testing.
* Security Advisory -- Patches fixing a security issue found during development, testing, or reported by users or a software security clearing house. A security advisory usually has one or more CVE names associated with each vulnerability found in each package.
* Product Enhancement Advisory -- Patches providing new features, improving functionality, or enhancing performance of a package.



[[ref.webui.patches.manage]]
== Manage Patches

Custom patches enable organizations to issue patch alerts for the packages in their custom channels, schedule deployment and manage patches across organizations.


image::patches_published_patches.png[scaledwidth=80%]


[WARNING]
====
If the organization is using both {productname} and {productname} Proxy server, then manage patches only on the {productname} server since the proxy servers receive updates directly from it.
Managing patches on a proxy in this combined configuration risks putting your servers out of synchronization.
====



[[s3-sm-errata-create]]
=== Creating and Editing Patches

To create a custom patch alert, proceed as follows:


. Click menu:Main Menu[Patches > Manage Patches > Published]. Then on the [guimenu]``Patches Management`` page, click [guimenu]``Create Patch``.
+


image::patches_create_patch.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Enter a label for the patch in the [guimenu]``Advisory`` field, ideally following a naming convention adopted by your organization.
+
ifdef::showremarks[]
#emap: Similar patch beginnings for SUSE? "Note that this label cannot begin with the letters "RH" (capitalized or not) to prevent confusion between custom errata and those issued by Red Hat."#
endif::showremarks[]
. Complete all remaining required fields, then click the btn:[Create Patch] button. View standard SUSE Alerts for examples of properly completed fields.


Patch management distinguishes between published and unpublished patches.

* [guimenu]``Published`` : this page displays the patch alerts the organization has created and disseminated. To edit an existing published patch, follow the steps described in <<s3-sm-errata-create>>. To distribute the patch, click btn:[Send Notification] in the [guimenu]``Send Patch Mail`` section on the top of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page. The patch alert is sent to the administrators of all affected systems.
* [guimenu]``Unublished`` : this page displays the patch alerts your organization has created but not yet distributed. To edit an existing unpublished patch, follow the steps described in <<s3-sm-errata-create>>. To publish the patch, click btn:[Publish Patch] on the top-right corner of the [guimenu]``Patch Details`` page. Confirm the channels associated with the patch and click the btn:[Publish Patch] button, now in the lower-right corner. The patch alert is moved to the [guimenu]``Published`` page awaiting distribution.

{productname} administrators can also create patches by cloning an existing one.
Cloning preserves package associations and simplifies issuing patches.
See <<ref.webui.patches.clone>> for instructions.

To edit an existing patch alert's details, click its advisory on the [guimenu]``Patches Management`` page, make the changes in the appropriate fields of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab, and click the btn:[Update Patch] button.
Click the [guimenu]``Channels`` tab to alter the patch's channel association.
Click the [guimenu]``Packages`` tab to view and modify its packages.

To delete patches, select their check boxes on the [guimenu]``Patches Management`` page, click the btn:[Delete Patches] button, and confirm the action.
Deleting published patches might take a few minutes.



[[s3-sm-errata-assign-packs]]
=== Assigning Packages to Patches

To assign packages to patches, proceed as follows:


. Select a patch, click the [guimenu]``Packages`` tab, then the [guimenu]``Add`` subtab.
. To associate packages with the patch being edited, select the channel from the [guimenu]``View`` drop-down box that contains the packages and click btn:[View]. Packages already associated with the patch being edited are not displayed. Selecting [guimenu]``All managed packages`` presents all available packages.
. After clicking btn:[View], the package list for the selected option appears. Note that the page header still lists the patch being edited.
. In the list, select the check boxes of the packages to be assigned to the edited patch and click btn:[Add Packages].
. A confirmation page appears with the packages listed. Click btn:[Confirm] to associate the packages with the patch. The [guimenu]``List/Remove`` subtab of the [guimenu]``Managed Patch Details`` page appears with the new packages listed.


When packages are assigned to a patch, the patch cache is updated to reflect the changes.
This update is delayed briefly so that users may finish editing a patch before all the changes are made available.
To initiate the changes to the cache manually, follow the directions to btn:[commit the changes immediately] at the top of the page.



[[s3-sm-errata-publish]]
=== Publishing Patches

After adding packages to the patch, the patch needs to be published to be disseminated to affected systems.
Follow this procedure to publish patches:

. On the top navigation bar, click menu:Main Menu[Patches > Manage Patches > Unpublished] to see all the unpublished patches listed.
. Click the patch [guimenu]``Advisory`` name to open the patch details pages.
. On the patch details page, click btn:[Publish Patch]. A confirmation page appears that will ask you to select which channels you want to make the patch available in. Choose the relevant channels.
. At the bottom of the page, click btn:[Publish Patch]. The patch published will now appear on the [guimenu]``Published`` page of [guimenu]``Manage Patches``.



[[s3-sm-errata-published]]
=== Published

Here all published patches are listed.
It is possible to perform the following actions:

* To create a patch, click btn:[Create Patch].
* To delete patches, select them first and then click btn:[Delete Patches].
* Click an Advisory name to open the patch details page.




[[s3-sm-errata-unpublished]]
=== Unpublished

Here all published patches are listed.
It is possible to perform the same actions as with published patches.
For more information, see <<s3-sm-errata-published>>.
Additionally, on a patch details page, you can click btn:[Publish Patch] for publishing.



[[ref.webui.patches.clone]]
== Cloning Patches

Patches can be cloned for easy replication and distribution as part of {productname}.


image::patches_clone_patches.png[scaledwidth=80%]


Only patches potentially applicable to one of your channels can be cloned.
Patches can be applicable to a channel if that channel was cloned from a channel to which the patch applies.
To access this functionality, click menu:Main Menu[Patches > Clone Patches].

On the [guimenu]``Clone Patches`` page, select the channel containing the patch from the [guimenu]``View`` drop-down box and click btn:[View].
When the patch list appears, select the check box of the patch to be cloned and click btn:[Clone Patch].
A confirmation page appears with the patch listed.
Click btn:[Confirm] to finish cloning.

The cloned patch appears in the [guimenu]``Unpublished`` patch list.
Verify the patch text and the packages associated with that patch, then publish the patch so it is available to users in your organization.
