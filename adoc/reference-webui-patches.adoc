(((WebLogic,Patches)))


The menu:Patches[]
 menu from the left bar helps tracking the availability and application of patches to your managed systems.

The menu:Patches[Patches]
 page displays all or relevant patches for at least one of your managed systems that have not been applied yet.

.Receiving Patches for Your System
[NOTE]

{suse}
distinguishes three types of patches: security updates, bug fix updates, and enhancement updates.
Each patch consists of a summary of the problem and solution, including the RPM packages fixing the problem.

Icons are used to identify the three types:

* image:fa-shield.svg[Security Alert,scaledwidth=1.2em] -- Security Updates available, _strongly_ recommended 
* image:fa-bug.svg[Bug Fix Alert,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- Bug Fix Updates available, recommended 
* image:spacewalk-icon-enhancement.svg[Enhancement Alert,scaledwidth=1.4em] -- Enhancement Updates available, optional 


A summary of each patch is provided in list form displaying its type, advisory ID, synopsis (with the severity as a textual prefix in case of security updates, such as "`critical`"
, "`important`"
, "`moderate`"
, or "`low`"
), number of affected systems in your network, and date updated.

In addition, you may view patches by product line at the following location: http://download.suse.com/patch/psdb/.
For more information on security updates, see https://www.suse.com/support/security/.

=== Applying Patches


Patches include a list of updated packages.
To apply patches to a system, the system must be entitled.

Apply all applicable patches to a system by clicking menu:Systems[Systems]
 in the top and left navigation bars.
Click the name of an entitled system.
Then in the menu:System Details[]
 page click the menu:Software[Patches]
 subtab.
When the relevant patch list appears, click menu:Select All[]
 then menu:Apply Patches[]
 on the bottom right-hand corner of the page.
Only patches not scheduled, scheduled but failed, or canceled patches are listed.
Pending updates are excluded.

In addition, users with appropriate roles can apply patches using two other methods:

* To apply a specific patch to one or more systems, locate it in the patch list and click the number of systems affected, which takes you to the menu:Affected Systems[] page of the menu:Patch Details[] page. Select the individual systems to be updated and click the menu:Apply Patches[] button. Double-check the systems to be updated on the confirmation page, then click the menu:Confirm[] button.
* To apply more than one patch to one or more systems, select the systems from the menu:Systems[] list. Click the menu:System Set Manager[] link in the left navigation bar, then click the menu:Systems[] tab. After ensuring the appropriate systems are selected, click the menu:Patches[] tab, select the patches to apply, and click the menu:Apply Patches[] button. Schedule a date and time for the patch to be applied. Default is the current date. Click the menu:Confirm[] button. You can follow the progress of the patch application via the menu:Pending Actions[] list. Refer to <<ref.webui.schedule>> for more details.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use scheduled package installation, the packages or patches are installed via the {susemgr}
daemon ([command]``rhnsd``). You must enable the {susemgr}
 daemon on your systems.
For more information about the {susemgr}
 daemon, see <<bp.contact.methods.rhnsd>>.
====


The following rules apply to patches:

* Each package is a member of one or more channels. If a selected system is not subscribed to a channel containing the package, the update will not be installed on that system.
* If a newer version of the package is already installed on the system, the update will not be installed.
* If an older version of the package is installed, the package will be upgraded.


[[s3-sm-errata-details]]
=== Patch Details

(((Web UI,viewing details)))


If you click the advisory of a patch in the menu:Relevant[]
 or menu:All[]
 pages, its menu:Patch Details[]
 page appears.
This page is further divided into the following tabs:

[[s4-sm-errata-details-details]]
==== menu:Patch Details[] > menu:Details[]


This subtab displays the patch report issued by {suse}
.
It provides a synopsis of the patch first (with the severity as a textual prefix in case of security updates, such as "`critical`"
, "`important`"
, "`moderate`"
, or "`low`"
), issue date, and any update dates.
This is followed by a description of the patch and the steps required to resolve the issue.

Below the menu:Affected Channels[]
 label, all channels that contain the affected package are listed.
Clicking a channel name displays the menu:Packages[]
 subtab of the menu:Channel Details[]
 page for that channel.
Refer to <<s3-sm-channel-details>> for more information.

Security updates list the specific vulnerability as tracked by http://cve.mitre.org.
This information is listed below the menu:CVEs[]
 label.

OVAL is an open vulnerability and assessment language promoted by Mitre, http://oval.mitre.org.
Clicking the link below the menu:Oval[]
 label downloads this information to your system.
More useful are the {suse}
 Update Advisories at https://www.suse.com/support/update/.

[[s4-sm-errata-details-packages]]
==== menu:Patch Details[] > menu:Packages[]


This page provides links to each of the updated RPMs by channel.
Clicking the name of a package displays its menu:Package Details[]
 page.

[[s4-sm-errata-details-systems]]
==== menu:Patch Details[] > menu:Affected Systems[]


This page lists systems affected by the patches.
You can apply updates here.
(See <<s3-sm-apply-errata>>.) Clicking the name of a system takes you to its menu:System Details[]
 page.
Refer to <<s3-sm-system-details>> for more information.

To determine whether an update has been scheduled, refer to the menu:Status[]
 column in the affected systems table.
Possible values are: N/A, Pending, Picked Up, Completed, and Failed.
This column identifies only the last action related to a patch.
For example, if an action fails and you reschedule it, this column shows the status of the patch as pending with no mention of the previous failure.
Clicking a status other than menu:N/A[]
 takes you to the menu:Action Details[]
 page.
This column corresponds to one on the menu:Patch[]
 tab of the menu:System Details[]
 page.

[[ref.webui.patches.search]]
== Advanced Search

(((Web UI,searching)))


The menu:Patches Search[]
 page allows you to search through patches by specific criteria.


image::patches_advanced_search_patches.png[scaledwidth=80%]


* menu:All Fields[] -- Search patches by synopsis, description, topic, or solution.
* menu:Patch Advisory[] -- The name or the label of the patch.
+
* menu:Package Name[] -- Search particular packages by name:
+

----
kernel
----
+
Results will be grouped by advisory.
For example, searching for 'kernel' returns all package names containing the string ``kernel``, grouped by advisory.
* menu:CVE[] -- The name assigned to the security advisory by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project at http://cve.mitre.org. For example:
+

----
CVE-2006-4535
----


To filter patch search results, check or uncheck the boxes next to the type of advisory:

* Bug Fix Advisory -- Patches that fix issues reported by users or discovered during development or testing.
* Security Advisory -- Patches fixing a security issue found during development, testing, or reported by users or a software security clearing house. A security advisory usually has one or more CVE names associated with each vulnerability found in each package.
* Product Enhancement Advisory -- Patches providing new features, improving functionality, or enhancing performance of a package.


[[ref.webui.patches.manage]]
== Manage Patches

(((Web UI,Managing Patches)))


Custom patches enable organizations to issue patch alerts for the packages in their custom channels, schedule deployment and manage patches across organizations.


image::patches_published_patches.png[scaledwidth=80%]


[WARNING]
====
If the organization is using both {susemgr}
and {susemgr}
Proxy server, then manage patches only on the {susemgr}
server since the proxy servers receive updates directly from it.
Managing patches on a proxy in this combined configuration risks putting your servers out of synchronization.
====

[[s3-sm-errata-create]]
=== Creating and Editing Patches

(((Web UI,Editing Patches)))


To create a custom patch alert, proceed as follows:


. On the top navigation bar, click menu:Patches[] , then select menu:Manage Patches[] on the left navigation bar. On the menu:Patches Management[] page, click menu:Create Patch[] .
+


image::patches_create_patch.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Enter a label for the patch in the menu:Advisory[] field, ideally following a naming convention adopted by your organization.
+
ifdef::showremarks[]
#emap: Similar patch
       beginnings for SUSE? "Note that this label cannot begin with the letters "RH" (capitalized or
       not) to prevent confusion between custom errata and those issued by Red Hat."#
endif::showremarks[]
. Complete all remaining required fields, then click the menu:Create Patch[] button. View standard SUSE Alerts for examples of properly completed fields.


Patch management distinguishes between published and unpublished patches.

* menu:Published[] : this page displays the patch alerts the organization has created and disseminated. To edit an existing published patch, follow the steps described in <<s3-sm-errata-create>>. To distribute the patch, click menu:Send Notification[] in the menu:Send Patch Mail[] section on the top of the menu:Patch Details[] page. The patch alert is sent to the administrators of all affected systems.
* menu:Unublished[] : this page displays the patch alerts your organization has created but not yet distributed. To edit an existing unpublished patch, follow the steps described in <<s3-sm-errata-create>>. To publish the patch, click menu:Publish Patch[] on the top-right corner of the menu:Patch Details[] page. Confirm the channels associated with the patch and click the menu:Publish Patch[] button, now in the lower-right corner. The patch alert is moved to the menu:Published[] page awaiting distribution.

{susemgr}
administrators can also create patches by cloning an existing one.
Cloning preserves package associations and simplifies issuing patches.
See <<ref.webui.patches.clone>> for instructions.
