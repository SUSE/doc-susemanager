[[ref.webui.audit.cve]]
== CVE Audit

The menu:Main Menu[Audit > CVE Audit] page will display a list of client systems with their patch status regarding a given CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) number.

image::audit_cve_audit.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[s1-cve-usage]]
=== Normal Usage

Proceed as follows if you want to verify that a client system has received a given CVE patch:

. Make sure that the CVE data is up-to-date. For more information, see <<sec-cve-maint>>.
. Click menu:Main Menu[Audit > CVE Audit] to open the [guimenu]``CVE Audit`` page.
. Input a 13-char CVE identifier in the [guimenu]``CVE Number`` field. The year setting will be automatically adjusted. Alternatively, set the year manually and add the last four digits.
. Optionally, uncheck the patch statuses you are not interested in.
. Click [guimenu]``Audit systems``.

Performing this procedure will result in a list of client systems, where each system comes with a [guimenu]``Patch Status`` belonging to the given CVE identifier.
Possible statuses are:

image:patch-status-affected-patch-inapplicable.png[scaledwidth=1em] Red - Affected, patches are available in channels that are not assigned:::
The system is affected by the vulnerability and {productname} has one or more patches for it, but at this moment, the channels offering the patches are not assigned to the system.

image:patch-status-affected-patch-applicable.png[scaledwidth=1em] Orange - Affected, at least one patch available in an assigned channel:::
The system is affected by the vulnerability, {productname} has at least one patch for it in a channel that is directly assigned to the system.

image:patch-status-not-affected.png[scaledwidth=1em] Grey - Not affected:::
The system does not have any packages installed that are patchable.

image:patch-status-patched.png[scaledwidth=1em] Green - Patched:::
A patch has already been installed.

In other words, it can mean the following:

* More than one patch might be needed to fix a certain vulnerability.
* The image:patch-status-affected-patch-applicable.png[scaledwidth=1em] Orange - state is displayed when {productname} has at least one patch in an assigned channel.
This might mean that, after installing such a patch, others might be needed—users should double check the CVE Audit page after applying a patch to be sure that their systems are not affected anymore.

For a more precise definitions of these states, see <<sec-cve-tips>>.

[NOTE]
.Unknown CVE Number
====
If the CVE number is not known to {productname}, an error message is displayed because {productname} cannot collect and display any audit data.
====

For each system, the [guimenu]``Next Action`` column contains suggestions on the steps to take to address the vulnerabilities.
Under these circumstances it is either sensible to install a certain patch or assign a new channel.
If applicable, a list of "`candidate`" channels or patches is displayed for your convenience.

You can also assign systems to a [guimenu]``System Set`` for further batch processing.



[[ref-api-usage]]
=== API Usage

An API method called `audit.listSystemsByPatchStatus` is available to run CVE audits from custom scripts.
Details on how to use it are available in the API guide.



[[sec-cve-maint]]
=== Maintaining CVE Data

To produce correct results, CVE Audit must periodically refresh the data needed for the search in the background.
By default, the refresh is scheduled at 11:00 PM every night.
It is recommended to run such a refresh right after the {productname} installation to get proper results immediately instead of waiting until the next day.

. In the Web interface, click menu:Main Menu[Admin > Task Schedules].
. Click the `cve-server-channels-default` schedule link.
. Click the `cve-server-channels-bunch` link.
. Click the btn:[Single Run Schedule] button.
. After some minutes, refresh the page and check that the scheduled run status is ``FINISHED``.

A direct link is also available on the menu:Main Main[Audit > CVE Audit] page ([guimenu]``extra CVE data update``).



[[sec-cve-tips]]
=== Tips and Background Information

Audit results are only correct if the assignment of channels to systems did not change since the last scheduled refresh (normally at 11:00 PM every night).
If a CVE audit is needed and channels were assigned or unassigned to any system during the day, a manual run is recommended.
For more information, see <<sec-cve-maint>>.

Systems are called "`affected`", "`not affected`" or "`patched`" not in an absolute sense, but based on information available to {productname}.
This implies that concepts such as "`being affected by a vulnerability`" have particular meanings in this context.
The following definitions apply:

System affected by a certain vulnerability:::
A system which has an installed package with version lower than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability.

System not affected by a certain vulnerability:::
A system which has no installed package that is also in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability.

System patched for a certain vulnerability:::
A system which has an installed package with version equal to or greater than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability.

Relevant patch:::
A patch known by {productname} in a relevant channel.

Relevant channel:::
A channel managed by {productname}, which is either assigned to the system, the original of a cloned channel which is assigned to the system, a channel linked to a product which is installed on the system or a past or future service pack channel for the system.

A notable consequence of the above definitions is that results can be incorrect in cases of unmanaged channels, unmanaged packages, or non-compliant systems.



[[ref.webui.audit.subscription]]
== [guimenu]``Subscription Matching``

To match subscriptions with your systems use the Subscription Matcher tool.

The [guimenu]``Edit Virtual Host Managers`` link in the upper right corner will take you to the menu:Main Menu[Systems > Virtual Host Managers] overview.
For more information about Virtual Host Managers, see <<ref.webui.systems.virt-host-managers>>.

image::audit_subscription_matching.png[scaledwidth=80%]

It gathers information about systems, subscriptions and pinned matches (fixed customer defined subscriptions to systems mapping) as input and returns the best possible match according to the SUSE Terms and Conditions.
The Subscription Matcher ([command]``subscription-matcher``) is also able to write CSV Reports.

* The [guimenu]``Subscriptions Report`` provides subscriptions report data when used
* The [guimenu]``Unmatched Products Report`` provides information on products and their systems when a match to a subscription cannot be found
* The [guimenu]``Error Report`` provides a list of errors raised during the matching process

Selecting menu:Main Menu[Audit > Subscription Matching] from the left navigation menu will provide you with an overview of all results generated by the Subscription Matcher.


[IMPORTANT]
.Subscription Matcher Accuracy
====
This tool's goal is to help provide visual coverage on current subscription use and support reporting.
The Subscription Matcher is excellent at matching systems and products registered with {productname}, however any systems, products or environments which are not found in the database will remain unmatched.
This tool is not intended to act as a replacement for auditing.
Auditing should always take precedence over subscription matching.
====



=== menu:Main Menu[Audit > Subscription Matching > Subscriptions]

The Subscription Matching overview provides subscription part numbers, product descriptions, policies, matched total subscriptions used and remaining, and the start and end dates of subscriptions.

.Subscription Matching Overview
image::smatching-overview.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Part Number::
Identifier of a particular product

Description::
Name of a particular product

Policy::
Kind of the subscription of this product

Matched/Total::
** {empty}
+

.Fully Matched
If the total amounts of a subscription are fully matched, the quantity column value is highlighted with a yellow warning triangle: image:fa-warning.svg[Warning,scaledwidth=0.9em]
** {empty}
+

.Susbscritions about to Expire
When a subscription will expire within less than 3 months, the record is highlighted.
** {empty}
+

.Expired Subscriptions
If a subscription is expired, the record for it is faded.

Start Date::
Start date of the subscription

End Date::
End date of the subscription

=== Subscription Matcher Reports

{productname} automatically generates up-to-date nightly status reports by matching your {suse} subscriptions with all your registered systems.
These reports are stored in [path]``/var/lib/spacewalk/subscription-matcher`` and provided in CSV format.
These CSV files may be opened with a spreadsheet application such as LibreOffice Calc.

If you want to schedule these reports to be produced at different times, or at a certain frequency or schedule a one time completion you can perform this task by editing the Taskomatic settings for the gatherer-matcher located in the {webui} at menu:Main Menu[Admin > Task Schedules > gatherer-matcher-default].

image::audit_subscription_matching_gatherer_matcher_default.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.audit.submatch.unmatched.systems]]
=== menu:Main Menu[Audit > Subscription Matching > Unmatched Products]

Selecting the menu:Main Menu[Subscription Matching > Unmatched Products] tab provides an overview of all systems the matcher could not find in the database or which were not registered with {productname}.
The [guimenu]``Unmatched Products`` overview contains product names and the number of systems which remain unmatched with known installed products.

.Unmatched Products
image::audit_subscription_matching_unmatched_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Show System List::
Select to open and display a list of all systems which were detected with an installed product but remain unmatched with a subscription.



[[ref.webui.audit.submatch.sub.pinning]]
=== menu:Main Menu[Audit > Subscription Matching > Pins]

The subscription pinning feature allows a user to instruct the subscription matcher to favor matching a specific subscription with a given system or group of systems.
This is achieved by creating pins.
Each pin contains information about the preferred subscription-system match.

image::audit_subscription_matching_pins.png[scaledwidth=80%]

[NOTE]
.Respecting Pins
====
In some cases the algorithm may determine that a specific pin cannot be respected, depending on the subscription's availability and applicability rules, in this case it will be shown as not satisfied.
====

The pins table displays a list of all pins.
Items in the list contain the status of pins, which can be ``satisfied``, `not    satisfied` and ``pending next run``.

* A pin is `satisfied` if its system and subscription was matched in the last matcher run.
* A pin is `not satisfied` if its system and subscription was _not_ matched in the last matcher run.
This can happen, for example, if the pin violates terms and conditions for subscriptions.
* A pin is in the `pending next run` state when it needs a new matcher run to be taken into account.
After the new run, the pin will become either `satisfied` or ``not satisfied``.

image::sm-pins.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Click the btn:[Add a Pin] button to open the [guimenu]``Available Systems`` window.
You may filter systems by name and select a system for the matcher to pin manually.

image::add-pin.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Within the menu:Subscriptions Available for Selected System[] window click the menu:Save Pin[] button to raise priority for subscription use on the selected system.



[[ref.webui.audit.submatch.submatch.messages]]
=== menu:Main Menu[Audit > Subscription Matching > Messages]

You can review all messages related to [guimenu]``Subscription Matching`` from the menu:Main Menu[Audit > Subscription Matching > Messages] overview.

The following status messages can be displayed.

Unknown Part Number::
Unsupported part number detected

Physical Guest::
Physical system is reported as virtual guest, check hardware data

Guest with Unknown Host::
Virtual guest has unknown host, assuming it is a physical system

Unknown CPU Count::
System has an unknown number of sockets, assuming 16.
You can try fixing this by scheduling hardware refresh for affected system.
