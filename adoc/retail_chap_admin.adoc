== Administration

This sections contains notes on administering your {smr} installation.
For general administration tasks, see the {susemgr} documentation at https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/

[[retail.sect.admin.branch_network_config]]
== Branch Server Network Configuration

The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways.
The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals.


.Procedure: Set up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN

In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the central server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals.
This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE and FTP services to terminals, which are configured through {smr} formulas in the {susemgr} {webui}.

. In the {susemgr} {webui}, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.
. In the [guimenu]``Branch Network`` section, set these parameters:
* Keep [guimenu]``Dedicated NIC`` checked
* In the [guimenu]``NIC`` field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN.
* In the [guimenu]``IP`` field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN.
* In the [guimenu]``Netmask`` field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN.
. Check [guimenu]``Enable Route`` if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN.
* Check [guimenu]``Enable NAT`` if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN.
* Select the [guimenu]``bind`` DNS forwarder mode.
* Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails.
* Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group.
. Click [btn]``Save`` to save your changes.


.Procedure: Set up a Branch Server with a Shared Network

In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card which is used to connect to the central server as well as the terminals.
This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE and FTP services to terminals, which are configured through {smr} formulas in the {susemgr} {webui}.
Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly:
* The [systemitem]``next-server`` option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work
* The [systemitem]``filename`` option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is [path]``/boot/pxelinux``)
* The [systemitem]``domain-name-servers`` option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution
====

. In the {susemgr} {webui}, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.
. In the [guimenu]``Branch Network`` section, set these parameters:
* Keep [guimenu]``Dedicated NIC`` unchecked
* Select which services to enable on the branch server’s firewall.
Ensure you include DNS, TFTP and FTP services.
* Select the [guimenu]``bind`` DNS forwarder mode.
* Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails.
* Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group.
. Click [btn]``Save`` to save your changes.
. Apply the salt state and synchronize your settings:

salt $branch_server_id state.apply image-sync

[[retail.sect.admin.branch_mass_config]]
== Branch Server Mass Configuration

You can either configure branch servers one by one using formulas (*TODO* see xxx) or create system groups of branch servers (*TODO* see yyy) or with a flexible command-line script.
Such a command-line script is suitable to do a mass configuration of branch servers.



// https://gitlab.suse.de/SLEPOS/SUMA_Retail/tree/master/python-susemanager-retail
For mass deployments use the script coming with the [package]``python-susemanager-retail`` package.
Install it on the central server.
When installed call it on the command-line with [command]``retail_yaml``.
This is the [command]``retail_yaml --help`` output:

----
usage: retail_yaml [-h] [--api-host API_HOST] [--api-user API_USER]
                   [--api-pass API_PASS] [--from-yaml FROM_YAML]
                   [--to-yaml TO_YAML]

Initialize Branch Server

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --api-host API_HOST   API host
  --api-user API_USER   API user
  --api-pass API_PASS   API password
  --from-yaml FROM_YAML
                        initialize retail system from YAML file
  --to-yaml TO_YAML     save structure of retail system to YAML file
----

The actual settings are filled in a ``YAML`` file that you will read with the [option]``--from-yaml`` option.
Here is the documentated [path]``example.yml`` coming with the package:

[[retail.sect.admin.deploy_terminals]]
== Deploying Terminals

TODO: https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/issues/5613

Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer.
However, the {susemgr} database does not have this information to begin with.
In order to tell {susemgr} what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups.


.Procedure: Create a Hardware Type Group

For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal.

. Determine the hardware type group name.
Prefix the name with [systemitem]``HWTYPE:``, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen.
For example:
+
----
HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Only use colons (``:``), hyphens (``-``) or underscores (``_``) in hardware type group names.
Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed.
====
+
. TODO: Apply hardware type



[[retail.sect.admin.saltboot]]
== Saltboot

TODO: https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/issues/5614

After you have created and applied a hardware type group, you will need to enable and configure the saltboot formula.

.Procedure: Install the Saltboot Formulas
Default formulas are supplied with {smr} and can be installed as RPM packages.

. The [package]``saltboot-formula`` RPM is provided as part of the {susemgr} installation process.
Save the formula custom states to [path]``/srv/salt/saltboot-formula/``.
Save the metadata files ([path]``form.yaml`` and [path]``metadata.yml``) to [path]``/srv/formula_metadata/saltboot-formula/``.
. Check that your formula has been installed correctly.
In the {susemgr} {webui}, navigate to menu:Salt[Formula Catalog] and check that the Saltboot formula appears in the list.
. Open the details page for the group or system you want to apply the formula to, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.
. Select the formulas you want to apply to the group or system and click [btn]``Save`` to save your changes.

After applying one or more formulas to a group or system, additional tabs will become available from the top menu, one for each formula selected.
These tabs give you specific configuration options for each formula.

When you have finished customizing your formula values you will need to apply highstate for them to take effect.
Do this by clicking [btn]``Apply Highstate`` from any formulas page.
Applying highstate will execute the state associated with the formula and configure the affected systems.

If you need to change any values, or re-apply formulas because of a failure, make the changes in the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab, save your changes, and re-apply the highstate.
Salt will ensure that only modified values are adjusted and restart or reinstall services only when necessary.

For additional information about Salt formulas, see: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html
