To delegate responsibilities within your organization, {susemgr}
provides several roles with varying degrees of access.
This list describes the permissions of each role and the differences between them:

* menu:User[] (normal user) -- Also known as a __System Group User__, this is the standard role associated with any newly created user. This person may be granted access to manage system groups and software channels, if the {susemgr} administrator sets the roles accordingly. The systems must be in system groups for which the user has permissions to manage them. However, all globally subscribable channels may be used by anyone.
* menu:SUSE Manager Administrator[] -- This role allows a user to perform any function available in {susemgr} . As the master account for your organization, the person holding this role can alter the privileges of all other accounts of this organization, and conduct any of the tasks available to the other roles. Like with other roles, multiple {susemgr} administrators may exist. Go to menu:Admin[Users] and click the check box in the menu:SUSE Manager Admin[] row. For more information, see <<ref.webui.admin.users>>.
+
A menu:SUSE Manager Administrator[]
can create foreign organizations; but a menu:SUSE Manager Administrator[]
can only create users for an organization if he is entitled with organization administrator privileges for this organization.
* menu:Organization Administrator[] -- This role provides a user with all the permissions other administrators have, namely the activation key, configuration, channel, and system group administrator. menu:Organization Administrator[] is not entitled to perform actions that belong to the menu:Admin[] tab (see <<ref.webui.admin>>).
* menu:Activation Key Administrator[] -- This role is designed to manage your collection of activation keys. A user assigned to this role can modify and delete any key within your organization.
* menu:Image Administrator[] -- This role is designed to manage Image building. Modifiable content includes Image Profiles, Image Builds and Image Stores. A user assigned with this role can modify and delete all content located under the menu:Image[] tab located on the left navigation menu. These changes will be applied across the organization.
* menu:Configuration Administrator[] -- This role enables a user to manage the configuration of systems within the organization, using either the {susemgr} Web interface or tool from the [package]#rhncfg-management# package.
* menu:Channel Administrator[] -- This role provides a user with full access to all software channels within your organization. This requires the {susemgr} synchronization tool ([command]``mgr-sync`` from the [package]#susemanager-tools# package). The channel administrator may change the base channels of systems, make channels globally subscribable, and create entirely new channels.
* menu:System Group Administrator[] -- This role limits authority to systems or system groups to which access is granted. The System Group Administrator can create new system groups, delete any assigned systems from groups, add systems to groups, and manage user access to groups.


Being a {susemgr}
administrator enables you to remove administrator rights from other users.
It is possible to remove your own privileges as long as you are not the only {susemgr}
administrator.
