== Topics

This section covers {susemgr} setup.
You will perform the following procedures:

* Start {susemgr} setup via YaST or command line
* Create the main administration account with the {susemgr} {webui}
* Name your base organization and add login credentials
* Sync the {sle} product channel from {scc}

[[suma-setup-with-yast-sumasetup]]
== {susemgr} Setup

This section will guide you through {susemgr} setup procedures.

.Procedure: {susemgr}Setup
. Login to the {susemgr} server desktop and perform one of the following actions to begin setup:

* Select menu:Applications[System Tools > YaST > SUSE Manager Setup].
* Open a terminal as root and type `yast2 susemanager_setup` to begin setup.

. From the introduction screen select menu:SUSE Manager Setup[Setup SUSE Manager from scratch] then select btn:[Next] to continue.

. Enter the email address that should receive status notifications about {susemgr}.
The number of emails sent from {susemgr} can be extensive, therefore notifications via email may be disabled from the {webui} after setup.
+

. Select btn:[Next] to continue.

. Enter your certificate information and a password. The password should be stored in a secure location.
+

[IMPORTANT]
.Certificate Password
====
_Without this password it will not be possible to set up a {susemgr} Proxy Server._
====
+

. Select btn:[Next] to continue.
+

image::quickstart-mgr-setup4.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. From the menu:SUSE Manager Setup[Database Settings] screen, enter a database user and password.
This password should be stored in a secure location.
Select btn:[Next] to continue.
+

image::quickstart-mgr-setup5.png[scaledwidth=80%]
//UPDATE devs added a skip button as scc is unnecessary for custom setups.
. Enter your {scc}[systemitem]``Organization Credentials``.
Open https://scc.suse.com/login to register or access to your organization credentials.
+

[NOTE]
.btn:[Skip]
====
If you are using SUSE Enterprise products, {susemgr} requires that you connect to {scc} for software, updates and patches.
You will not be able to synchronize or provide Enterprise channels to your clients without this information.

However if you would like to work with open source software channels and repositories then select the btn:[Skip] button to continue.
You can setup your {scc} credentials or configure inter-server sync at a later time.
====

image::quickstart-mgr-setup9.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Select btn:[Next] to continue.

. Select btn:[Yes] to run setup when prompted.

. Once setup has completed, select btn:[Next] to continue.
You will be presented with the new {susemgr} {webui} address.
+

. Select btn:[Finish] to complete {susemgr} setup.

In the next section you will create the administrator's account and synchronize with {scc}.

[[suma.setup.with.yast.admin]]
=== Creating the Main Administration Account

This section will walk you through creating your organizations main administration account for {susemgr}.

[WARNING]
.Admin and User Accounts
====
The main administration account is the _highest authority account_ within {susemgr} and therefore account access information should be stored in a secure location.

For security it is recommended that the main administrator creates _low level admin accounts_ designated for administration of organizations and individual groups.
====

[[suma.setup.admin.account]]
.Procedure: Setup the Main Administration Account
. Open a browser and direct it to the {susemgr} Server URL provided after completing setup.

. Add your organization name to the menu:Create Organization[Organization Name] field.

. Add your username and password to the menu:Create Organization[Desired Login] and menu:Create Organization[Desired Password] fields.

. Fill in the Account Information fields including an email for system notifications.

. Select menu:Create Organization[] to finish creating your administration account.
+

You should now be presented with the {susemgr} Front Page. In the next section you will prepare the server for connecting the first client.

[[quickstart.first.channel.sync]]
=== Syncing Products from {scc}

{scc} (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release and architecture.
After synchronizing with SCC clients may receive updates, and be organized into groups and assigned to specific product software channels.

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[[proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. From the {susemgr} {webui} start page select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].

. From the menu:Main Menu[Admin > Setup Wizard] page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
Wait a moment for the products list to populate.
If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
This table lists architecture, channels, and status information.
For more information, see:
ifdef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<reference-webui-admin.adoc#ref-webui-product-wizard, Product Wizard>>

ifndef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<vle.webui.admin.wizard.products>>
endif::[]
+

image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+

. Since Your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.

* Add channels to {susemgr} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
* Start product synchronization by clicking the btn:[Add Products] button.

After adding the channel {susemgr} will schedule the channel to be copied.
This can take a long time as {susemgr} will copy channel software sources from the {suse} repositories located at {scc} to local [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` directory of your server.


[TIP]
.PostgreSQL and Transparant Huge Pages
====
In some environments, _Transparent Huge Pages_ provided by the kernel may slow down PostgreSQL workloads significantly.

To disable _Transparant Huge Pages_ set the [option]``transparent_hugepage`` kernel parameter to [option]``never``.
This has to be changed in [path]``/etc/default/grub`` and added to the line [option]``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT``, for example:

----
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/sda1 splash=silent quiet showopts elevator=noop transparent_hugepage=never"
----

To write the new configuration run [command]``grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg``.
To update the grub2 during boot run [command]``grub2-install /dev/sda``.
====

Monitor channel synchronization process in real-time by viewing channel log files located in the directory [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync``:

----
tailf /var/log/rhn/reposync/<CHANNEL_NAME>.log
----

After the channel sync process has completed proceed to:
