[[at.introduction.cobbler]]
== Introduction

{susemgr} features the Cobbler server, which allows administrators to centralize system installation and provisioning infrastructure.
Cobbler is an installation server that provides various methods of performing unattended system installations.
It can be used on server, workstation, or guest systems, in full or para-virtualized environments.

Cobbler offers several tools for pre-installation guidance, automated installation file management, installation environment management, and more.
This section explains some of the supported features of Cobbler, including:

* Installation environment analysis using the [command]``cobbler check`` command
* Multi-site installation server configuration using the [command]``cobbler replicate`` command
* Virtual machine guest installation automation with the [command]``koan`` client-side tool
* Building installation ISOs with PXE-like menus using the [command]``cobbler buildiso`` command (for {susemgr} systems with x86_64 architecture)

For more detailed Cobbler documentation, see http://cobbler.github.io/manuals/.

[IMPORTANT]
.Supported Cobbler Functions
====
{suse} only support those Cobbler functions that are either listed within our formal documentation or available via the web interface and API.
====



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.reqs]]
== Cobbler Requirements

To use Cobbler for system installation with PXE, you will require a TFTP server. {susemgr} installs a TFTP server by default.
To PXE boot systems, you will require a DHCP server, or have access to a network DHCP server. Edit the [path]``/etc/dhcp.conf`` configuration file to change [option]``next-server`` to the hostname or IP address of your Cobbler server.


[IMPORTANT]
.Correct Hostname Configuration
====
Cobbler uses hostnames as a unique key for each system.
If you are using the [option]``pxe-default-image`` to onboard bare metal systems, make sure every system has a unique hostname.
Non-unique hostnames will cause all systems with the same hostname to have the configuration filess overwritten when a provisioning profile is assigned.
====



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.reqs.settings]]
=== Configuring Cobbler with /etc/cobbler/settings

Cobbler configuration is primarily managed using the [path]``/etc/cobbler/settings`` file.
Cobbler will run with the default settings unchanged.
All configurable settings are explained in detail in the [path]``/etc/cobbler/settings`` file, including information on each setting, and recommendations.


[NOTE]
.Supported Languages
====
If {susemgr} complains that language ``en`` was not found within the list of supported languages available at [path]``/usr/share/YaST2/data/languages``, remove the [option]``lang`` parameter in the [path]``/etc/cobbler/settings`` file, or add a valid parameter such as ``en_US``.

For more on this topic, see https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc?id=7018334.
====



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.req.dhcp]]
=== Cobbler and DHCP

Cobbler uses DHCP to automate bare metal installations from a PXE boot server.
You must have administrative access to the network's DHCP server, or be able to configure DHCP directly on the the Cobbler server.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.reqs.dhcp.notmanaged]]
==== Configuring an Existing DHCP Server

If you have existing DHCP server, you will need to edit the DHCP configuration file so that it points to the Cobbler server and PXE boot image.

As root on the DHCP server, edit the [path]``/etc/dhcpd.conf`` file and append a new class with options for performing PXE boot installation.
For example:

====
----
allow booting;
allow bootp; <1>
class "PXE" <2>
{match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 9) = "PXEClient"; <3>
next-server 192.168.2.1; <4>
filename "pxelinux.0";} <5>
----
<1> Enable network booting with the [systemitem]``bootp`` protocol.
<2> Create a class called ``PXE``.
<3> A system configured to have PXE first in its boot priority identifies itself as ``PXEClient``.
<4> As a result, the DHCP server directs the system to the Cobbler server at ``192.168.2.1``.
<5> The DHCP server retrieves the [path]``pxelinux.0``bootloader file.
====


[[advanced.topics.cobbler.reqs.dhcp.kvm]]
==== Setting up PXE Boot in KVM

It is possible to set up PXE booting in KVM, however we do not recommend you use this method for production systems.
This method can replace the [guilabel]``next-server`` setting on a DHCP server, as described in <<advanced.topics.cobbler.reqs.dhcp.notmanaged>>.
Edit the network XML description with [command]``virsh``:

. Produce an XML dump of the current description:
+

----
virsh net-dumpxml --inactive network > network.xml
----

. Open the XML dump file at [path]``network.xml`` with a text editor and add a [systemitem]``bootp`` parameter within the [systemitem]``<dhcp>``` element:
+

----
<bootp file='/pxelinux.0' server='192.168.100.153'/>
----

. Install the updated description:
+

----
virsh net-define network.xml
----

Alternatively, use the [command]``net-edit`` subcommand, which will also perform some error checking.

</dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
----

====



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.reqs.tftp]]
=== Xinetd and TFTP

{susemgr} uses the [daemon]``atftpd`` daemon, but it can also use Xinetd and TFTP.
The [daemon]``atftpd`` daemon is the recommended method for PXE serviices, and is installed by default.
Usually, you do not have to change its configuration, but if you have to, use the {yast} Sysconfig Editor.

The [daemon]``Xinetd`` daemon manages a suite of services including TFTP, the FTP server used for transferring the boot image to a PXE client.

To configure TFTP, enable the service via Xinetd by editing the [path]``/etc/xinetd.d/tftp`` file as the root user and change the [option]``disable = yes`` line to ``disable = no``.

Before TFTP can serve the [path]``pxelinux.0`` boot image, you must start the Xinetd service.
Start {yast} and use menu:System[Services Manager] to configure the [daemon]``Xinetd`` daemon.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.reqs.sync.tftp]]
=== Syncing TFTP Contents to {productname} Proxies

It is possible to synchronize Cobbler-generated TFTP contents to {susemgr} proxies to perform PXE booting using proxies.



==== Installation

On the {susemgr} Server as the root user, install the [systemitem]``susemanager-tftpsync`` package:

----
zypper install susemanager-tftpsync
----


On the {susemgrproxy} systems as the root user , install the [systemitem]``susemanager-tftpsync-recv`` package:

----
zypper install susemanager-tftpsync-recv
----



==== Configuring {susemgrproxy}

Execute [path]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` on the {susemgrproxy} systems.

This setup script asks for hostnames and IP addresses of the {productname} server and the proxy.
Additionally, it asks for the `tftpboot` directory on the proxy.
For more information, see the output of [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh --help``.



==== Configuring {productname} Server

As the root user, execute [path]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` on {susemgr} Server:

----
configure-tftpsync.sh proxy1.example.com proxy2.example.com
----

Execute [command]``cobbler sync`` to initially push the files to the proxy systems.
This will succeed if all listed proxies are properly configured.

[NOTE]
.Changing the List of Proxy Systems
====
You can call [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` to change the list of proxy systems.
You must always provide the full list of proxy systems.
====


[NOTE]
.Reinstalling a Configured Proxy
====
If you reinstall an already configured proxy and want to push all the files again you must remove the cache file at [path]``/var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json`` before you can call [command]``cobbler sync`` again.
====



==== Requirements

The {susemgr} Server must be able to access the {susemgrproxy} systems directly.
You cannot push using a proxy.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.reqs.service]]
=== Syncing and Starting the Cobbler Service

Before starting the Cobbler service, run a check to make sure that all the prerequisites are configured according to your requirements using the [command]``cobbler check`` command.

If configuration is correct, start the {susemgr} server with this command:

----
/usr/sbin/spacewalk-service start
----

[WARNING]
====
Do not start or stop the [command]``cobblerd`` service independent of the {productname} service.
Doing so may cause errors and other issues.

Always use [command]``/usr/sbin/spacewalk-service`` to start or stop {productname}.
====



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.adddistro]]
== Adding a Distribution to Cobbler


If all Cobbler prerequisites have been met and Cobbler is running, you can use the Cobbler server as an installation source for a distribution:

Make installation files such as the kernel image and the initrd image available on the Cobbler server.
Then add a distribution to Cobbler, using either the Web interface or the command line tools.

For information about creating and configuring {ay} or Kickstart distributions from the {productname} interface, refer to <<ref.webui.systems.autoinst.distribution>>.

To create a distribution from the command line, use the [command]``cobbler`` command as root:

----
cobbler distro add --name=`string`--kernel=`path`--initrd=`path`
----


[option]``--name=``[replaceable]``string`` option::
A label used to differentiate one distribution choice from another (for example, ``sles12server``).

[option]``--kernel=``[replaceable]``path`` option::
Specifies the path to the kernel image file.

[option]``--initrd=``[replaceable]``path`` option::
specifies the path to the initial ram disk (initrd) image file.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.addprofile]]
== Adding a Profile to Cobbler

Once you have added a distribution to Cobbler, you can add profiles.

Cobbler profiles associate a distribution with additional options like {ay} or Kickstart files.
Profiles are the core unit of provisioning and there must be at least one Cobbler profile for every distribution added.
For example, two profiles might be created for a Web server and a desktop configuration.
While both profiles use the same distribution, the profiles are for different installation types.

For information about creating and configuring Kickstart and {ay} profiles in the {productname} interface, refer to <<ref.webui.systems.autoinst.profiles>>.

Use the [command]``cobbler`` command as root to create profiles from the command line:

----
cobbler profile add --name=string --distro=string [--kickstart=url] \
  [--virt-file-size=gigabytes] [--virt-ram=megabytes]
----

[option]``--name=``[replaceable]``string``::
A unique label for the profile, such as `sles12webserver` or ``sles12workstation``.

[option]``--distro=``[replaceable]``string``::
The distribution that will be used for this profile.
For adding distributions, see <<advanced.topics.cobbler.adddistro>>.

[option]``--kickstart=``[replaceable]``url``::
The location of the Kickstart file (if available).

[option]``--virt-file-size=``[replaceable]``gigabytes``::
The size of the virtual guest file image (in gigabytes).
The default is 5{nbsp}GB.

[option]``--virt-ram=``[replaceable]``megabytes``::
The maximum amount of physical RAM a virtual guest can consume (in megabytes).
The default is 512{nbsp}MB.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.addsystem]]
== Adding a System to Cobbler

Once the distributions and profiles for Cobbler have been created, add systems to Cobbler.
System records map a piece of hardware on a client with the Cobbler profile assigned to run on it.

[NOTE]
====
If you are provisioning using [command]``koan`` and PXE menus alone, it is not required to create system records.
They are useful when system-specific Kickstart templating is required or to establish that a specific system should always get specific content installed.
If a client is intended for a certain role, system records should be created for it.
====

For information about creating and configuring automated installation from the {productname} interface, refer to <<s4-sm-system-details-kick>>.

Run this command as the root user to add a system to the Cobbler configuration:

----
cobbler system add --name=string --profile=string \
  --mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
----


[option]``--name=``[replaceable]``string``::
 A unique label for the system, such as `engineering_server` or ``frontoffice_workstation``.

[option]``--profile=``[replaceable]``string``::
Specifies the name of one of the profiles added in <<advanced.topics.cobbler.addprofile>>.

[option]``--mac-address=``[replaceable]``AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF``::
Allows systems with the specified MAC address to automatically be provisioned to the profile associated with the system record when they are being installed.

For more options, such as setting hostname or IP addresses, refer to the Cobbler manpage ([command]``man cobbler``).



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.templates]]
== Using Cobbler Templates

The {susemgr} web interface allows you to create variables for use with Kickstart distributions and profiles.
For more information on creating Kickstart profile variables, refer to <<s4-sm-system-kick-details-variables>>.

Kickstart variables are part of an infrastructure change in {susemgr} to support templating in Kickstart files.
Kickstart templates are files that describe how to build Kickstart files, rather than creating specific Kickstarts.
The templates are shared by various profiles and systems that have their own variables and corresponding values.
These variables modify the templates and a template engine parses the template and variable data into a usable Kickstart file.
Cobbler uses an advanced template engine called Cheetah that provides support for templates, variables, and snippets.

Advantages of using templates include:

* Robust features that allow administrators to create and manage large amounts of profiles or systems without duplication of effort or manually creating Kickstarts for every unique situation.
* While templates can become complex and involve loops, conditionals and other enhanced features and syntax, you can also create simpler Kickstart files without such complexity.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.templates.usage]]
=== Using Templates

Kickstart templates can have static values for certain common items such as PXE image file names, subnet addresses, and common paths such as [path]``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/``.
However, templates differ from standard Kickstart files in their use of variables.

For example, a standard Kickstart file may have a networking section similar to this:

----
network --device=eth0 --bootproto=static --ip=192.168.100.24 \
  --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=192.168.100.1 --nameserver=192.168.100.2
----

In a Kickstart template file, the networking section would look like this instead:

----
network --device=$net_dev --bootproto=static --ip=$ip_addr \
  --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=$my_gateway --nameserver=$my_nameserver
----

These variables are substituted with the values set in your Kickstart profile variables or in your system detail variables.
If the same variable is defined in both the profile and the system detail, then the system detail variable takes precedence.

[NOTE]
====
The template for the autoinstallation has syntax rules which relies on punctuation symbols.
To avoid clashes, they need to be properly treated.
====

In case the autoinstallation scenario contains any shell script using variables like ``$(example)``, its content should be escaped by using the backslash symbol: ``\$(example)``.

If the variable named `example` is defined in the autoinstallation snippet, the templating engine will evaluate `$example` with its content.
If there is no such variable, the content will be left unchanged.
Escaping the kbd:[$] symbol will prevent the templating engine from evaluating the symbol as an internal variable.
Long scripts or strings can be escaped by wrapping them with the `\#raw` and `\#end raw` directives.
For example:

----
#raw
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0..2}; do
 echo "$i - Hello World!"
done
#end raw
----

Also, pay attention to scenarios like this:

----
#start some section (this is a comment)
echo "Hello, world"
#end some section (this is a comment)
----

Any line with a kbd:[#] symbol followed by a whitespace is treated as a comment and is therefore not evaluated.

For more information about Kickstart templates, refer to the Cobbler project page at:

https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/wiki/KickstartTemplating



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.templates.snippets]]
=== Kickstart Snippets

If you have common configurations across all Kickstart templates and profiles, you can use the Snippets feature of Cobbler to take advantage of code reuse.

Kickstart snippets are sections of Kickstart code that can be called by a [option]``$SNIPPET()`` function that will be parsed by Cobbler and substituted with the contents of the snippet.

For example, you might have a common hard drive partition configuration for all servers, such as:

----
clearpart --all
part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary
part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary
part swap --recommended

part pv.00 --size=1 --grow

volgroup vg00 pv.00
logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000
----

Save this snippet of the configuration to a file like [path]``my_partition`` and place the file in [path]``/var/lib/cobbler/snippets/``, where Cobbler can access it.

Use the snippet by calling the [option]``$SNIPPET()`` function in your Kickstart templates.
For example:

----
$SNIPPET('my_partition')
----

Wherever you invoke that function, the Cheetah parser will substitute the function with the snippet of code contained in the [path]``my_partition`` file.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.koan]]
== Using Koan

Whether you are provisioning guests on a virtual machine or reinstalling a new distribution on a running system, Koan works in conjunction with Cobbler to provision systems.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.koan.virt]]
=== Using Koan to Provision Virtual Systems

If you have created a virtual machine profile as documented in <<advanced.topics.cobbler.addprofile>>, you can use [command]``koan`` to initiate the installation of a virtual guest on a system.
For example, create a Cobbler profile with the following command:

----
cobbler add profile --name=virtualfileserver \
  --distro=sles12-x86_64-server --virt-file-size=20 --virt-ram=1000
----

This profile is for a fileserver running {sls}{nbsp}12 with a 20{nbsp}GB guest image size and allocated 1{nbsp}GB of system RAM.
To find the name of the virtual guest system profile, use the [command]``koan`` command:

----
koan --server=hostname --list-profiles
----

This command lists all the available profiles created with [command]``cobbler profile add``.

Create the image file, and begin installation of the virtual guest system:

----
koan --virt --server=cobbler-server.example.com \
  --profile=virtualfileserver --virtname=marketingfileserver
----

This command specifies that a virtual guest system be created from the Cobbler server (hostname [server]``cobbler-server.example.com``) using the `virtualfileserver` profile.
The [option]``virtname`` option specifies a label for the virtual guest, which by default is the system's MAC address.

Once the installation of the virtual guest is complete, it can be used as any other virtual guest system.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.koan.reinstall]]
=== Using Koan to Reinstall Running Systems

[command]``koan`` can replace a still running system with a new installation from the available Cobbler profiles by executing the following command __on the system to be reinstalled__:

----
koan --replace-self --server=hostname --profile=name
----

This command, running on the system to be replaced, will start the provisioning process and replace the system with the profile in [option]``--profile=name`` on the Cobbler server specified in [option]``--server=hostname``.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.buildiso]]
== Building ISOs with Cobbler

Some environments might lack PXE support.
The Cobbler [command]``buildiso`` command creates a ISO boot image containing a set of distributions and kernels, and a menu similar to PXE network installations.
Define the name and output location of the boot ISO using the [option]``--iso`` option.


[NOTE]
.ISO Build Directory
====
Depending on Cobbler-related systemd settings (see [path]``/usr/lib/systemd/system/cobblerd.service``) writing ISO images to public [path]``tmp`` directories will not work.
====

----
cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso
----

The boot ISO includes all profiles and systems by default.
Limit these profiles and systems using the [option]``--profiles`` and [option]``--systems`` options.

----
cobbler buildiso --systems="system1,system2,system3" \
  --profiles="profile1,profile2,profile3"
----

[NOTE]
====
Building ISOs with the [command]``cobbler buildiso`` command is supported for all architectures except the {zsystems} architecture.
====



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.baremetal]]
== Bare Metal Provisioning

Systems that have not yet been provisioned are called bare metal systems.
You can provision bare metal systems using Cobbler.
Once a bare metal system has been provisioned in this way, it will appear in the [guilabel]``Systems`` list, where you can perform regular provisioning with autoinstallation, for a completely unattended installation.


[[advanced.topics.cobbler.baremetal.requirements]]
=== Bare Metal Provisioning System Requirements

To successfully provision a bare metal system, you will require a fully patched {susemgr} server, version 2.1 or higher.

The system to be provisioned must have x86_64 architecture, with at least 1&#160;GB RAM, and be capable of PXE booting.

The server uses TFTP to provision the bare metal client, so the appropriate port and networks must be configured correctly in order for provisioning to be successful. In particular, ensure that you have a DHCP server, and have set the [option]``next-server`` parameter to the {susemgr} server IP address or hostname.


[[advanced.topics.cobbler.baremetal.enabling]]
=== Enabling Bare Metal Systems Management

Bare metal systems management can be enabled or disabled in the {webui} by clicking menu:Admin[SUSE Manager Configuration > Bare-metal systems].

[NOTE]
====
New systems are added to the organization of the administrator who enabled the bare metal systems management feature. To change the organization, log in as an Administrator of the required organization, and re-enable the feature.
====

Once the feature has been enabled, any bare metal system connected to the server network will be automatically added to the organization when it is powered on.
The process can take a few minutes, and the system will automatically shut down once it is complete.
After the reboot, the system will appear in the [guilabel]``Systems`` list.
Click on the name of the system to see basic information, or go to the [guilabel]``Properties``, [guilabel]``Notes``, and [guilabel]``Hardware`` tabs for more details.
You can migrate bare metal systems to other organizations if required, using the [guilabel]``Migrate`` tab.


[[advanced.topics.cobbler.baremetal.provisioning]]
=== Provisioning Bare Metal Systems

Provisioning bare metal systems is similar to provisioning other systems, and can be done using the [guilabel]``Provisioning`` tab.
However, you will not be able to schedule provisioning, it will happen automatically as soon as the system is configured and powered on.

[NOTE]
.Bare Metal and System Set Manager
====
System Set Manager can be used with bare metal systems, although not all features will be available, because bare metal systems do not have an operating system installed.
This limitation also applies to mixed sets that contain bare metal systems; all features will be re-enabled if the bare metal systems are removed from the set.
====


[[advanced.topics.cobbler.baremetal.troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting Bare Metal Systems

If a bare metal system on the network is not automatically added to the [guilabel]``Systems`` list, check these things first:

* You must have the [path]``pxe-default-image`` package installed.
* File paths and parameters must be configured correctly. Check that the [path]``vmlinuz0`` and [path]``initrd0.img`` files, which are provided by [path]``pxe-default-image``, are in the locations specified in the [path]``rhn.conf`` configuration file.
* Ensure the networking equipment connecting the bare metal system to the {susemgr} server is working correctly, and that you can reach the {susemgr} server IP address from the server.
* The bare metal system to be provisioned must have PXE booting enabled in the boot sequence, and must not be attempting to boot an operating system.
* The DHCP server must be responding to DHCP requests during boot. Check the PXE boot messages to ensure that:
** the DHCP server is assigning the expected IP address
** the DHCP server is assigning the the {susemgr} server IP address as [option]``next-server`` for booting.
* Ensure Cobbler is running, and that the Discovery feature is enabled.

If you see a blue Cobbler menu shortly after booting, discovery has started.
If it does not complete successfully, temporarily disable automatic shutdown in order to help diagnose the problem. To disable automatic shutdown:

. Select [option]``pxe-default-profile`` in the Cobbler menu with the arrow keys, and press the Tab key before the timer expires.
. Add the kernel boot parameter [option]``spacewalk-finally=running`` using the integrated editor, and press Enter to continue booting.
. Enter a shell with the username [option]``root`` and password [option]``linux`` to continue debugging.

[IMPORTANT]
.Duplicate profiles
====
Due to a technical limitation, it is not possible to reliably distinguish a new bare metal system from a system that has previously been discovered.
Therefore, we recommended that you do not power on bare metal systems multiple times, as this will result in duplicate profiles.
====
