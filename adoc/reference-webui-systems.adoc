 for 24 hours or more. 
image::systems_inactive.png[]


Checking in means that Zypper on {sle}
or Red Hat Update Agent on {rhel}
client systems connects to {susemgr}
to see if there are any updates available or if any actions have been scheduled.
If you see a message telling you that check-ins are not taking place, the client system is not successfully connecting to {susemgr}
.
The reason may be one of the following: 

* The system is not entitled to any {susemgr} service. System profiles that remain unentitled for 180 days (6 months) are removed. 
* The system is entitled, but the {susemgr} daemon ([systemitem]``rhnsd`` ) has been disabled on the system. Refer to <<_bp.contact.methods.rhnsd>> for instructions on restarting and troubleshooting. 
* The system is behind a firewall that does not allow connections over [systemitem]``https`` (port 443). 
* The system is behind an HTTP proxy server that has not been properly configured. 
* The system is connected to a {susemgr} Proxy Server or {susemgr} that has not been properly configured. 
* The system itself has not been properly configured, perhaps pointing at the wrong {susemgr} Server. 
* The system is not in the network. 
* Some other barrier exists between the system and the {susemgr} Server. 


[[_ref.webui.systems.systems.rregistered]]

[[_s3_sm_system_details]]
== System Details


When systems are registered to {susemgr}
, they are displayed on the menu:Systems[Overview]
 page.
Here and on any other page, clicking the name takes you to the menu:System Details[]
 page of the client, where all kinds of administrative tasks can be performed, including the removal of a system. 

[NOTE]
====
The menu:Delete System[]
 link in the upper right of this screen refers to the system profile only.
Deleting a host system profile will not destroy or remove the registration of guest systems.
Deleting a guest system profile does not remove it from the list of guests for its host, nor does it stop or pause the guest.
It does, however, remove your ability to manage it via {susemgr}
. 

If you mistakenly deleted a system profile from {susemgr}
, you may re-register the system using the bootstrap script or [command]``rhnreg_ks`` manually. 
====


The Details page has numerous subtabs that provide specific system information and other identifiers unique to the system.
The following sections discuss these tabs and their subtabs in detail. 

[[_s4_sm_system_details_details]]

This system summary page displays the system status message and the following key information about the system: 

.menu:System Status[]::
This message indicates the current state of your system in relation to {susemgr}
. 
+


[NOTE]
====
If updates are available for any entitled system, the message menu:Software Updates Available[]
 appears, displaying the number of critical and non-critical updates and the sum of affected packages.
To apply these updates, click menu:Packages[]
 and select some or all packages to update, then click menu:Upgrade Packages[]
. 
====
.menu:System Info[]
Hostname::
The host name as defined by the client system.
A machine can have one and only one hostname. 

FQDN::
The FQDN(Names) listed here represents the host.domain that the machine answers to.
A machine can have any number of FQDNs.
Keep in mind that FQDN is not equal to hostname. 

IP Address::
The IP address of the client. 

IPv6 Address::
The IPv6 address of the client. 

Virtualization::
If the client is a virtual machine, the type of virtualization is listed. 

UUID::
Displays the universally unique identifier. 

Kernel::
The kernel installed and operating on the client system. 

{susemgr} System ID::
A unique identifier generated each time a system registers with {susemgr}
. 
+


[NOTE]
====
The system ID can be used to eliminate duplicate profiles from {susemgr}
.
Compare the system ID listed on this page with the information stored on the client system in the [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid``
 file.
In that file, the system's current ID is listed under ``system_id``.
The value starts after the characters ``ID-``.
If the value stored in the file does not match the value listed in the profile, the profile is not the most recent one and may be removed. 
====
Activation Key::
Displays the activation key used to register the system. 

Installed Products::
Lists the products installed on the system. 

Lock Status::
Indicates whether a system has been locked. 
+
Actions cannot be scheduled for locked systems on the Web interface until the lock is removed manually.
This does not include preventing automated patch updates scheduled via the Web interface.
To prevent the application of automated patch updates, deselect menu:Auto Patch Update[]
from the menu:System
Details[Details > Properties]
subtab.
For more information, refer to <<_s5_sm_system_details_properties>>. 
+
Locking a system can prevent you from accidentally changing a system.
For example, the system may be a production system that should not receive updates or new packages until you decide to unlock it. 
+


[IMPORTANT]
====
Locking a system in the Web interface _will not_ prevent any actions that originate from the client system.
For example, if a user logs in to the client directly and runs {yast}
 Online Update (on {slea}
) or [command]``pup`` (on {rhela}
), the update tool will install available patches even if the system is locked in the Web interface. 

Locking a system _does not_ restrict the number of users who can access the system via the Web interface.
If you want to restrict access to the system, associate that system with a System Group and assign a System Group Administrator to it.
Refer to <<_ref.webui.systems.systemgroups>> for more information about System Groups. 
====
+
It is also possible to lock multiple systems via the System Set Manager.
Refer to <<_s4_sm_ssm_misc_lock>> for instructions. 

.menu:Subscribed Channels[]::

+
The so-called OSA status is also displayed for client systems registered with {susemgr}
that have the OSA dispatcher (osad) configured. 
+
Push enables {susemgr}
customers to immediately initiate tasks rather than wait for those systems to check in with {susemgr}
.
Scheduling actions through push is identical to the process of scheduling any other action, except that the task can immediately be carried out instead of waiting the set interval for the system to check in. 
+
In addition to the configuration of {susemgr}
, to receive pushed actions each client system must have the [systemitem]``osad``
package installed and its service started. 

Auto Patch Update::
Indicates whether this system is configured to accept updates automatically. 

System Name::
By default, the host name of the client is displayed, but a different system name can be assigned.

image::system_details_traditional_edit.png[]



. On {slea} clients, subscribe the system to the {susemgr} Tools child channel. Then use Zypper to install the [command]``rhncfg``, [command]``rhncfg-client``, and [command]``rhncfg-actions`` packages, if not already installed: 
+

----
zypper in rhncfg rhncfg-client rhncfg-actions
----
+
On {rhela}
clients, subscribe the system to the Tools child channel.
Then use [command]``up2date`` or [command]``yum`` to install the [command]``rhncfg``, [command]``rhncfg-client``, and [command]``rhncfg-actions`` packages, if not already installed: 
+

----
yum install rhncfg rhncfg-client rhncfg-actions
----
. Log in to the system as root and add the following file to the local {susemgr} configuration directory: [path]``allowed-actions/scripts/run`` . 
+
** Create the necessary directory on the target system: 
+

----
mkdir -p /etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/script
----
** Create an empty [path]``run`` file in that directory to act as a flag to {susemgr} , signaling permission to allow remote commands: 
+

----

Reactivation keys include this system's ID, history, groups, and channels.
This key can then be used only once with the [command]``rhnreg_ks`` command line utility to re-register this system and regain all {susemgr}
 settings.
Unlike typical activation keys, which are not associated with a specific system ID, keys created here do not show up within the menu:Activation Keys[]
 page. 
image::system_details_reactivation.png[]


Reactivation keys can be combined with activation keys to aggregate the settings of multiple keys for a single system profile.
For example: 

----
rhnreg_ks --server=`server-url`
\
  --activationkey=`reactivation-key`
,`activationkey`
--force
----

[WARNING]
====
When autoinstalling a system with its existing {susemgr}
profile, the profile uses the system-specific activation key created here to re-register the system and return its other {susemgr}
settings.
For this reason, you should not regenerate, delete, or use this key (with [command]``rhnreg_ks``) while a profile-based autoinstallation is in progress.
If you do, the autoinstallation will fail.

[[_s4_sm_system_details_kick]]
=== System Details >  Provisioning  [Management]


The menu:Provisioning[]
 tab and its subtabs allow you to schedule and monitor {ay}
 or Kickstart installations and to restore a system to its previous state. 

.Available for Clients Using the "`Traditional`"Method
[NOTE]
====
The note menu:Provisioning[]
 tab will be available when adding a client using the "`traditional`"
 method (system type ``management``). Using Salt the menu:Provisioning[]
 tab will not be available (system type ``salt``). 
====

{ay}
is a {sle}
and Kickstart is a Red Hat utility{mdash}
both allow you to automate the reinstallation of a system.
Snapshot rollbacks provide the ability to revert certain changes on the system.
You can roll back a set of RPM packages, but rolling back across multiple update levels is not supported.
Both features are described in the sections that follow. 

[[_s5_sdc_provisioning_kickstart]]
==== System Details  >  Provisioning  >  Autoinstallation

The menu:Schedule[]
 subtab allows you to configure and schedule an autoinstallation for this system.
For background information about autoinstallation, see <<_ref.webui.systems.autoinst>>. 
image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_schedule_wizard.png[]


In the menu:Schedule[]
 subtab, schedule the selected system for autoinstallation.
Choose from the list of available profiles. 

[NOTE]
====
You must first create a profile before it appears on this subtab.
If you have not created any profiles, refer to <<_ref.webui.systems.autoinst.profiles.create>> before scheduling an autoinstallation for a system. 
====


To alter autoinstallation settings, click the menu:Advanced Configuration[]
 button.
Configure the network connection and post-installation networking information.
You can aggregate multiple network interfaces into a single logical "bonded" interface.
In menu:Kernel Options[]
 specify kernel options to be used during autoinstallation. menu:Post Kernel Options[]
 are used after the installation is complete and the system is booting for the first time.
Configure package profile synchronization. 

Select a time for the autoinstallation to begin and click menu:Schedule Autoinstall and Finish[]
 for all changes to take effect and to schedule the autoinstallation. 

Alternatively, click menu:Create PXE Installation Configuration[]
 to create a Cobbler system record.
The selected autoinstallation profile will be used to automatically install the configured distribution next time that particular system boots from PXE.
In this case {susemgr}
 and its network must be properly configured to allow boot using PXE. 

[NOTE]
====
Any settings changed on the menu:Advanced Configuration[]
 page will be ignored when creating a PXE installation configuration for Cobbler. 
====


The menu:Variables[]
 subtab can be used to create Kickstart variables, which substitute values in Kickstart files.
To define a variable, create a name-value pair ([replaceable]``name/value``) in the text box. 

For example, to {kickstart}
a system that joins the network of a specific organization (for example the Engineering department) you can create a profile variable to set the IP address and the gateway server address to a variable that any system using that profile will use.
Add the following line to the menu:Variables[]
 text box: 

----
IPADDR=192.168.0.28
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
----


To use the system variable, use the name of the variable in the profile instead of the value.
For example, the [option]``network`` portion of a {kickstart}
 file could look like the following: 

----
network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$IPADDR \
  --gateway=$GATEWAY
----


The [option]``$IPADDR`` will be ``192.168.0.28``, and the [option]``$GATEWAY`` will be ``192.168.0.1``. 

[NOTE]
====
There is a hierarchy when creating and using variables in {kickstart}
files.
System {kickstart}
variables take precedence over profile variables, which in turn take precedence over distribution variables.
Understanding this hierarchy can alleviate confusion when using variables in {kickstart}
s. 
====


Using variables are one part of the larger Cobbler infrastructure for creating templates that can be shared between multiple profiles and systems.
For more information about Cobbler and {kickstart}
templates, refer to <<_advanced.topics.cobbler>>. 

[[_s5_sdc_provisioning_powermgnt]]
==== System Details  >  Provisioning  >  Power Management

{susemgr}
allows you to power on, off, and reboot systems via the IPMI protocol if the systems are IPMI-enabled. 
image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_power_management.png[]


You need a fully patched {susemgr}
installation.
To use any power management functionality, IPMI configuration details must be added to {susemgr}
.
First select the target system on the systems list, then select menu:Provisioning[Power
     Management]
.
On the displayed configuration page, edit all required fields (marked with a red asterisk) and click menu:Save[]
. 

Systems can be powered on, off, or rebooted from the configuration page via corresponding buttons.
Note that any configuration change is also saved in the process.
The menu:Save and Get Status[]
 button can also be used to query for the system's power state.
If configuration details are correct, a row is displayed with the current power status ("on" or "off"). If a power management operation succeeds on a system, it will also be noted in its menu:Events[History]
 subtab. 

Power management functionalities can also be used from the system set manager to operate on multiple systems at the same time.
Specifically, you can change power management configuration parameters or apply operations (power on, off, reboot) to multiple systems at once: 


. Add the respective systems to the system set manager as described in <<_ref.webui.systems.ssm>>. 
. Click menu:Manage[] (in the upper right corner), then menu: Provisioning[Power Management Configuration] to change one or more configuration parameters for all systems in the set. Note that any field left blank will not alter the configuration parameter in selected systems. 
. When all configuration parameters are set correctly, click menu:Manage[] , then menu:Provisioning[Power Management Operations] to power on, off or reboot systems from the set. 


To check that a power operation was executed correctly, click menu:System Set Manager[Status]
 on the left-hand menu, then click the proper line in the list.
This will display a new list with systems to which the operation was applied.
If errors prevent correct execution, a brief message with an explanation will be displayed in the menu:Note[]
 column. 

This feature uses Cobbler power management, thus a Cobbler system record is automatically created at first use if it does not exist already.
In that case, the automatically created system record will not be bootable from the network and will reference a dummy image.
This is needed because Cobbler does not currently support system records without profiles or images.
The current implementation of Cobbler power management uses the fence-agent tools to support multiple protocols besides IPMI.
Those are not supported by {susemgr}
but can be used by adding the fence agent names as a comma-separated list to the [command]``java.power_management.types`` configuration parameter. 

[[_s4_sm_system_details_shots]]
==== System Details  >  Provisioning  >  Snapshots


Snapshots enable you to roll back the system's package profile, configuration files, and {susemgr}
settings. 
image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_snapshot_index.png[]


Snapshots are always captured automatically after an action takes place.
The menu:Snapshots[]
 subtab lists all snapshots for the system, including the reason the snapshot was taken, the time it was taken, and the number of tags applied to each snapshot. 

.Technical Details
[NOTE]
====
* A snapshot is always taken _after_ a successful operation and not before, as you might expect. One consequence of taking snapshots after the action is that, to undo action number X, then you must roll back to the snapshot number X-1. 
* It is possible to disable snapshotting globally (in [path]``rhn.conf`` set ``enable_snapshots = 0``), but it is enabled by default. No further fine tuning is possible. 

====


To revert to a previous configuration, click the menu:Reason[]
 for the snapshot and review the potential changes on the provided subtabs, starting with menu:Rollback[]
. 

.Unsupported Rollback Scenarios
[IMPORTANT]
====
Snapshot roll backs support the ability to revert _certain_ changes to the system, but not in every scenario.
For example, you can roll back a set of RPM packages, but rolling back across multiple update levels is not supported. 

Rolling back an SP migration is also not supported. 
====


Each subtab provides the specific changes that will be made to the system during the rollback: 

* group memberships, 
* channel subscriptions, 
* installed packages, 
* configuration channel subscriptions, 
* configuration files, 
* snapshot tags. 


When satisfied with the reversion, return to the menu:Rollback[]
 subtab and click the menu:Rollback to Snapshot[]
 button.
To see the list again, click menu:Return to snapshot list[]
. 

.Background Information About Snapshots
[NOTE]
====
There is no maximum number of snapshots that {susemgr}
will keep, thus related database tables will grow with system count, package count, channel count, and the number of configuration changes over time.
Installations with more than a thousand systems should consider setting up a recurring cleanup script via the API or disabling this feature altogether. 

There is currently no integrated support for "`rotated
      snapshots`"
. 

Snapshot rollback gets scheduled like any other action, this means the rollback usually does not happen immediately. 
====

[[_s5_sm_system_details_shots_tags]]
==== System Details >  Provisioning  >  Snapshot Tags


Snapshot tags provide a means to add meaningful descriptions to your most recent system snapshot.
This can be used to indicate milestones, such as a known working configuration or a successful upgrade. 

To tag the most recent snapshot, click menu:Create System Tag[]
, enter a descriptive term in the menu:Tag name[]
 field, and click the menu:Tag Current Snapshot[]
 button.
You may then revert using this tag directly by clicking its name in the Snapshot Tags list.
To delete tags, select their check boxes, click menu:Remove Tags[]
, and confirm the action. 

[[_s4_sm_system_details_virtualization]]
=== System Details >  Virtualization


This tab allows you to create a new virtual guest on a host system or change the status of virtual guests. 
image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_snapshot_index.png[]

The menu:Virtualization[]
 tab has two subtabs, menu:Details[]
 and menu:Kickstart[]
.
These tabs appear the same for both virtual hosts and guests, but the functionality only makes sense for virtual hosts.
It is not possible to create a guest system that runs on another guest system. 

[float]
[[_sdc_virt_host_place]]
==== System Details > Virtualization> Details

menu:Details[]
 is the default tab.
For host systems, it presents a table of the host system's virtual guests.
For each guest system, the following information is provided: 

menu:Status[]::
This field indicates whether the virtual system is running, paused, stopped, or has crashed. 

menu:Updates[]::
This field indicates whether patches (errata) applicable to the guest have yet to be applied. 

menu:Base Software Channel[]::
This field indicates the Base Channel to which the guest is subscribed. 

[NOTE]
====
If a guest system has not registered with {susemgr}
, this information appears as plain text in the table. 
====


If you have System Group Administrator responsibilities assigned for your guest systems, a user might see the message menu:You do not have permission to access this system[]
 in the table.
This is because it is possible to assign virtual guests on a single host to multiple System Group Administrators.
Only users that have System Group Administrator privileges on the host system may create new virtual guests.

=== Managing Activation Keys

(((account,disabling)))

(((account,creating)))


From the menu:Activation Key[]
 page organize activation keys for channel management. 
image::systems_activation_keys.png[]


To create an activation key: 

[[_pro.ref.manager.activationkey]]
.Procedure: Creating Activation Keys
. Select menu:Systems[Activation Keys] from the left bar. 
. Click the menu:Create Key[] link at the upper right corner. 
. menu:Description[] -- Enter a menu:Description[] to identify the generated activation key. 
. menu:Key[] -- Either choose automatic generation by leaving this field blank or enter the key you want to generate in the menu:Key[] field. This string of characters can then be used with [command]``rhnreg_ks`` to register client systems with {susemgr} . Refer to <<_s3_sm_system_keys_multiple>> for details. 
+

.Allowed Characters
WARNING: 
ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2011-03-24 - ke: bwiedemann 20110210: # wirklich alle? auch "'\ und
        0 bytes? Also see the quick starts! 2016-02-17 - moio: ," are not allowed <> (){} will
        get removed automatically #
endif::showremarks[]

Do not insert commas or double quotes in the key.
All other characters are allowed, but `<> (){}` (this includes the space) will get removed automatically.
If the string is empty, a random one is generated. 

Commas are problematic because they are used as separator when two or more activation keys are used at once. 
. menu:Usage[] -- The maximum number systems that can be registered with the activation key concurrently. Leave blank for unlimited use. Deleting a system profile reduces the usage count by one and registering a system profile with the key increases the usage count by one. 
. menu:Base Channels[] -- The primary channel for the key. This can be either the `{susemgr} Default` channel, a {suse} provided channel, or a custom base channel. 
+ 
Selecting `{susemgr}
Default` allows client systems to register with the {suse}
-provided default channel that corresponds with their installed version of {sle}
.
You can also associate the key with a custom base channel.
If a system using this key is not compatible with the selected channel, it will fall back to the {susemgr}
default channel. 
. menu:Add-on System Types[] -- The supplemental system types for the key, e.{nbsp} g. Virtualization Host. All systems will receive these system types with the key. 
. menu:Contact Method[] - Select how clients communicate with {susemgr} . menu:Default[] (Pull) waits for the client to check in. With menu:Push via SSH[] and menu:Push via SSH tunnel[] the server contacts the client via SSH (with or without tunnel) and pushes updates and actions, etc. 
+ 
For more information about contact methods, see <<_bp.systems.management>>. 
. menu:Universal Default[] -- Select whether this key should be considered the primary activation key for your organization. 
+

.Changing the Default Activation Key
WARNING: Only one universal default activation key can be defined per organization.
If a universal key already exists for this organization, you will unset the currently used universal key by activating the check box. 
. Click menu:Create Activation Key[] . 


To create more activation keys, repeat the steps above. 

After creating the unique key, it appears in the list of activation keys along with the number of times it has been used.
Only Activation Key Administrators can see this list.
At this point, you can configure the key further, for example, associate the key with child channels (for example, the Tools child channel), packages (for example, the [package]#rhncfg-actions#
 package) and groups.
Systems registered with the key get automatically subscribed to them. 

To change the settings of a key, click the key's description in the list to display its menu:Details[]
 page (see <<_fig_s1_sm_systems_akey_details>>). Via additional tabs you can select child channels, packages, configuration channels, group membership and view activated systems.
Modify the appropriate tab then click the menu:Update Activation Key[]
 button.
To disassociate channels and groups from a key, deselect them in the respective menus by kbd:[Ctrl]
-clicking their highlighted names.
To remove a key entirely, click the menu:Delete Key[]
 link in the upper right corner of the menu:Details[]
 page.
In the upper right corner find also the menu:Clone Key[]
 link. 

.Activation Key Details With Subtabs [[_fig_s1_sm_systems_akey_details]]
image::systems_activation_key_details.png[]


Any (client tools) package installation requires that the Client Tools channel is available and the menu:Provisioning[]
 check box is selected.
The Client Tools channel should be selected in the menu:Child Channels[]
 tab. 

After creating the activation key, you can see in the menu:Details[]
 tab a check box named menu:Configuration File Deployment[]
.
If you select it, all needed packages are automatically added to the menu:Packages[]
 list.
By default, the following packages are added: [package]#rhncfg#
, [package]#rhncfg-client#
, and [package]#rhncfg-actions#
. 

If you select menu:Virtualization Host[]
 you automatically get the following package: [package]#rhn-virtualization-host#
. 

Adding the [package]#osad#
 package makes sense to execute scheduled actions immediately after the schedule time.
When the activation key is created, you can add packages with selecting the key (menu:Software[Activation Keys]
), then on the activation key details tab, go for the menu:Packages[]
 subtab and add [package]#osad#
. 

To disable system activations with a key, uncheck the corresponding box in the menu:Enabled[]
 column in the key list.
The key can be re-enabled by selecting the check box.
Click the menu:Update Activation Keys[]
 button on the bottom right-hand corner of the page to apply your changes. 

[[_s3_sm_system_keys_multiple]]
=== Using Multiple Activation Keys at Once


Multiple activation keys can be specified at the command line or in a single autoinstallation profile.
This allows you to aggregate the aspects of various keys without re-creating a specific key for every system that you want to register, simplifying the registration and autoinstallation processes while slowing the growth of your key list.
Separate keys with a comma at the command line with [command]``rhnreg_ks`` or in a {kickstart}
 profile in the menu:Activation Keys[]
 tab of the menu:Autoinstallation Details[]
 page. 

Registering with multiple activation keys requires some caution.
Conflicts between some values cause registration to fail.
Conflicts in the following values do not cause registration to fail, a combination of values is applied: software packages, software child channels, and configuration channels.
Conflicts in the remaining properties are resolved in the following manner: 

* Base software channels: registration fails. 
* System types: registration fails. 
* Enable configuration flag: configuration management is set. 


Do not use system-specific activation keys along with other activation keys; registration fails in this event. 

You are now ready to use multiple activation keys at once.

[[_ref.webui.systems.virt_host_managers]]
== Virtual Host Managers


Third party hypervisors and hypervisor managers such as VMWare vCenter are called "`Virtual Host Managers`"
 (VHM) within {susemgr}
.
These managers can manage one or multiple virtual hosts, which in turn may contain virtual guests. {susemgr}
 ships with a tool called [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` that can connect to VHMs using their API, and request information about virtual hosts.
This tool is automatically invoked via Taskomatic nightly, therefore you need to configure your VHMs via XMLRPC APIs. [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` maintains the concept of optional modules, where each module enables a specific Virtual Host Manager. 

Proceed to menu:Systems[Virtual Host
   Managers]
 page in the {webui}
 to begin working with a Virtual Host Manager.
In the upper right you can click menu:Create[]
 and select either menu:VMware-based[]
 or menu:File-based[]
. 

[[_ref.webui.systems.virt_host_managers.vmware]]
=== VMware-Based


After selecting menu:Create[VMware-based]
 enter the location of your VMware-based virtual host.
Enter a menu:Label[]
, menu:Hostname[]
, menu:Port[]
, menu:Username[]
 and menu:Password[]
.
Finally click the menu:Add Virtual Host Manager[]
 button.
For detailed information on working with a VMware-based Virtual Host Manager, see <<_advanced.topics.adding.vmware.esxi.host>>.

[[_ref.webui.systems.virt_host_managers.file]]
=== File-Based


If you are using an unsupported virtual host manager, you can create and use a file formatted in JSON containing information about a host and all managed guest machines.
After selecting menu:Create[File-Based]
 enter a label and URL leading to the location of this file. 
image::systems_virtual_host_managers_file.png[]


.VMWare vCenter Installations without Direct Access
[NOTE]
====
The file-based is not meant to be used with manually crafted files.
It only meant to be used with the output of [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` against some other module.
File-based is suitable for VMWare vCenter installations for which no direct API access is possible from the SUSE Manager Server. 

The solution is to run [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` from somewhere else in the network and save the produced JSON data for further processing.
