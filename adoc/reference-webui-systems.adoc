If you select menu:Main Menu[Systems > Overview], an overview of all Systems appears.
From this page you can select systems to perform actions on and may create system profiles.



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.intro]]
== Overview Conventions

The menu:Main Menu[Systems > Overview] page displays a list of all your registered systems.
Several columns provide information about each system:

Select box::
Systems without a system type cannot be selected. To select systems, mark the appropriate check boxes.
Selected systems are added to the *System Set Manager*, where actions can be carried out simultaneously on all systems in the set.
For more information, see:
// TODO Update github link
 <<ref.webui.systems.ssm>>.
+

System::
The name of the system specified during registration.
The default name is the host name of the system.
Clicking the name of a system displays its *System Details* page.
For more information, see:
// TODO Update github link
<<s3-sm-system-details>>
+

* image:spacewalk-icon-virtual-host.svg[Virtual Host,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- Virtual Host.
* image:spacewalk-icon-virtual-guest.svg[Virtual Guest,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- Virtual Guest.
* image:fa-236-non-virtual-system.svg[Non-Virtual System,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- Non-Virtual System.
* image:spacewalk-icon-unprov-system.svg[Unprovisioned System,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- Unprovisioned System.
+

Updates::
Shows which type of update action is applicable to the system or confirms that the system is up-to-date.
Some icons are linked to related tasks.
For example, the standard Updates icon is linked to the menu:Upgrade[] subtab of the packages list, while the Critical Updates icon links directly to the menu:Software Patches[] page.
+

* image:fa-check-circle.svg[Check Circle,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- System is up-to-date.
* image:fa-exclamation-circle.svg[Exclamation Circle,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- Critical patch (errata) available, update _strongly_ recommended.
* image:fa-warning.svg[Warning,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- Updates available and recommended.
* image:fa-question-circle.svg[Question,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- System not checking in properly (for 24 hours or more).
* image:fa-lock.svg[Lock,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- System is locked; actions prohibited.
* image:fa-rocket.svg[Rocket,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- System is being deployed using AutoYaST or Kickstart.
* image:fa-clock-o.svg[Clock,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- Updates have been scheduled.
* image:fa-times-circle.svg[Times,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- System not entitled to any update service.
+

Patches::
Total number of patch alerts applicable to the system.
+

Packages:: Total number of package updates for the system, including packages related to patch alerts and newer versions of packages not related to patch alerts.
For example, if a client system that has an earlier version of a package installed gets subscribed to the appropriate base channel (such as {sle} 12 SP2), that channel may have an updated version of the package.
If so, the package appears in the list of available package updates.
+

[IMPORTANT]
.Package Conflict
====
If {susemgr} identifies package updates for the system, but the package updater (such as Red Hat Update Agent or {yast}) responds with a message such as "Your system is fully updated", a conflict likely exists in the system's package profile or in the [path]``up2date`` configuration file.
To resolve the conflict, either schedule a package list update or remove the packages from the package exceptions list.
For more information, see:
// TODO update github link
<<s3-sm-system-details>>
====
+

Configs::
Total number of configuration files applicable to the system.
+

Base Channel::
The primary channel for the system based on its operating system.
For more information, see:
// TODO update github link
<<ref.webui.channels.software>>
+

System Type::
Shows whether the system is managed and at what service level.

Links in the navigation bar below menu:Systems[] enable you to select and view predefined sets of your systems.
All of the options described above can be applied within these pages.

=== Systems > Inactive

The menu:Systems[Systems > Inactive Systems] page displays systems that have not checked in with {susemgr} for 24 hours or more.

image::systems_inactive.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Checking in means that Zypper on {sle} or Red Hat Update Agent on {rhel} client systems connects to {susemgr} to see if there are any updates available or if any actions have been scheduled.
If you see a message telling you that check-ins are not taking place, the client system is not successfully connecting to {susemgr}.

The reason may be one of the following:

* The system is not entitled to any {susemgr} service.
System profiles that remain unentitled for 180 days (6 months) are removed.
* The system is entitled, but the {susemgr} daemon ([systemitem]``rhnsd`` ) has been disabled on the system.
Refer to <<bp.contact.methods.rhnsd>> for instructions on restarting and troubleshooting.
* The system is behind a firewall that does not allow connections over [systemitem]``https`` (port 443).
* The system is behind an HTTP proxy server that has not been properly configured.
* The system is connected to a {susemgr} Proxy Server or {susemgr} that has not been properly configured.
* The system itself has not been properly configured, perhaps pointing at the wrong {susemgr} Server.
* The system is not in the network.
* Some other barrier exists between the system and the {susemgr} Server.



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.rregistered]]
=== Systems > Recently Registered

image::systems_currency_report.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.types]]
=== Systems > System Types

System Types define the set of functionalities available for each system in {susemgr}
such as the ability of installing software or creating guest virtual machines.

image::systems_system_types.png[scaledwidth=80%]

A list of profiled systems follows, with their base and add-on system types shown in the appropriate columns.
To change system types, select the systems you want to modify, and click either the btn:[Add System Type] or btn:[Remove System Type] button.



[[s3-sm-system-details]]
== System Details

When systems are registered to {susemgr}, they are displayed on the menu:Systems[Overview] page.
Here and on any other page, clicking the name of a system takes you to the *System Details* page of the client, where various types of administrative tasks can be performed.

[NOTE]
====
The menu:Delete System[] link in the upper right of this screen refers to the system profile only.
Deleting a host system profile will not destroy or remove the registration of guest systems.
Deleting a guest system profile does not remove it from the list of guests for its host, nor does it stop or pause the guest.
It does, however, remove your ability to manage it via {susemgr}.

If you mistakenly deleted a system profile from {susemgr}, you may re-register the system using the bootstrap script or [command]``rhnreg_ks`` manually.
====

The Details page has numerous subtabs that provide specific system information and other identifiers unique to the system.
The following sections discuss these tabs and their subtabs in detail.



[[s4-sm-system-details-details]]
=== System Details  >  Details

This page is not accessible from the left bar.
However, clicking the name of a system anywhere in the Web interface displays such a System Details page.
By default, the menu:Systems Details[Details > Overview] subtab is displayed.
Other tabs are available, depending on the system type and add-on system type.

For example Traditional systems and Salt systems details  display different tabs.

.System Details (Traditional)
image::system_details_traditional_overview.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.System Details (Salt)
image::system_details_salt_overview.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[s5-sm-system-details-overview]]
==== System Details >  Details  >  Overview

This system summary page displays the system status message and the following key information about the system:

menu:System Status[]::
This message indicates the current state of your system in relation to {susemgr}.
+

[NOTE]
====
If updates are available for any entitled system, the message menu:System Details[Software Updates Available] appears, displaying the number of critical and non-critical updates and the sum of affected packages.
To apply these updates, click menu:System Details[Packages] then select some or all packages to update, then click btn:[Upgrade Packages].
====
+

menu:System Info[]::

Hostname:::
The host name as defined by the client system.
A machine can have one and only one hostname.

FQDN:::
The FQDN(Names) listed here represents the host.domain that the machine answers to.
A machine can have any number of FQDNs.
Keep in mind that FQDN is not equal to hostname.

IP Address:::
The IP address of the client.

IPv6 Address:::
The IPv6 address of the client.

Virtualization:::
If the client is a virtual machine, the type of virtualization is listed.

UUID:::
Displays the universally unique identifier.

Kernel:::
The kernel installed and operating on the client system.

{susemgr} System ID:::
A unique identifier generated each time a system registers with {susemgr}.
+

[NOTE]
====
The system ID can be used to eliminate duplicate profiles from {susemgr}.
Compare the system ID listed on this page with the information stored on the client system in the [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid`` file.
In that file, the system's current ID is listed under ``system_id``.
The value starts after the characters ``ID-``.
If the value stored in the file does not match the value listed in the profile, the profile is not the most recent one and may be removed.
====
+

Activation Key:::
Displays the activation key used to register the system.

Installed Products:::
Lists the products installed on the system.

Lock Status:::
Indicates whether a system has been locked.
+

Actions cannot be scheduled for locked systems on the Web interface until the lock is removed manually.
This does not include preventing automated patch updates scheduled via the Web interface.
To prevent the application of automated patch updates, deselect menu:System Details[Properties > Auto Patch Update].
For more information, refer to <<s5-sm-system-details-properties>>.
+

Locking a system can prevent you from accidentally changing a system.
For example, the system may be a production system that should not receive updates or new packages until you decide to unlock it.
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
Locking a system in the Web interface _will not_ prevent any actions that originate from the client system.
For example, if a user logs in to the client directly and runs {yast} Online Update (on {slea}) or [command]``pup`` (on {rhela}), the update tool will install available patches even if the system is locked in the Web interface.

Locking a system _does not_ restrict the number of users who can access the system via the Web interface.
If you want to restrict access to the system, associate that system with a System Group and assign a System Group Administrator to it.
Refer to <<ref.webui.systems.systemgroups>> for more information about System Groups.
====
+

It is also possible to lock multiple systems via the System Set Manager.
Refer to <<s4-sm-ssm-misc-lock>> for instructions.


menu:Subscribed Channels[]::
List of subscribed channels.
Clicking a channel name takes you to the menu:Basic Channel Details[] page.
To change subscriptions, click the menu:(Alter Channel Subscriptions)[] link right beside the title to assign available base and child channels to this system.
When finished making selections, click the menu:Change Subscriptions[] button to change subscriptions and the base software channel.
For more information, see:
// TODO update github link
<<s5-sm-system-details-channels-software>>.


Base Channel:::
The first line indicates the base channel to which this system is subscribed.
The base channel should match the operating system of the client.


Child Channels:::
The subsequent lines of text, which depend on the base channel, list child channels.
An example is the menu:SUSE Manager Tools[] channel.


menu:System Events[]::

Checked In:::
The date and time at which the system last checked in with {susemgr}.

Registered:::
The date and time at which the system registered with {susemgr} and created this profile.

Last Booted:::
The date and time at which the system was last started or restarted.
+

[NOTE]
====
Systems with Salt or Management system type can be rebooted from this screen.

. Select menu:Schedule system reboot[] .
. Provide the earliest date and time at which the reboot may take place.
. Click the menu:Schedule Reboot[] button in the lower right.

When the client checks in after the scheduled start time, {susemgr} will instruct the system to restart itself.
====
+

menu:System Properties[]::

System Types:::
Lists system types and add-on types currently applied to the system.

Notifications:::
Indicates the notification options for this system.
You can activate whether you want to receive e-mail notifying you of available updates for this system.
In addition, you may activate to include systems in the daily summary e-mail.

Contact Method:::
Available methods: Default (Pull), Push via SSH, and Push via SSH tunnel.
+

The so-called OSA status is also displayed for client systems registered with {susemgr} that have the OSA dispatcher (osad) configured.
+

Push enables {susemgr} customers to immediately initiate tasks rather than wait for those systems to check in with {susemgr}.
Scheduling actions through push is identical to the process of scheduling any other action, except that the task can immediately be carried out instead of waiting the set interval for the system to check in.
+

In addition to the configuration of {susemgr}, to receive pushed actions each client system must have the [systemitem]``osad`` package installed and its service started.

Auto Patch Update:::
Indicates whether this system is configured to accept updates automatically.

System Name:::
By default, the host name of the client is displayed, but a different system name can be assigned.

Description:::
This information is automatically generated at registration.
You can edit the description to include any information you want.

Location:::
This field displays the physical address of the system if specified.


Clicking the btn:[Edit These Properties] link beside the menu:System Details[Overview > System Properties] title opens the menu:System Details[Properties] subtab.
From this page you can edit any text fields you choose, then click the btn:[Update Properties] button to confirm.

This setting keeps you aware of all advisories pertaining to the system.
Anytime an update is released for the system, you receive an e-mail notification.
+

The daily summary reports system events that affect packages, such as scheduled patch updates, system reboots, or failures to check in.
In addition to including the system here, you must activate to receive e-mail notification in the menu:Your Preferences[] page of the menu:Overview[] category.

Contact Method:::
Select one of the following contact methods:

* menu:Edit System Details[Pull](Default, may be Osad, )
* menu:Edit System Details[Push via SSH]
* menu:Edit System Details[Push via SSH tunnel]

[[varentry-system-details-properties-auto]]
Auto Patch Update:::
If this box is checked, available patches are automatically applied to the system when it checks in (Pull) or immediately if you select either Push option.
This action takes place without user intervention.
The {susemgr} Daemon ([systemitem]``rhnsd``) must be enabled on the system for this feature to work.
+

.Conflicts With Third Party Packages
NOTE: Enabling auto-update might lead to failures because of conflicts between system updates and third party packages.
To avoid failures caused by those issues, it is better to leave this box unchecked.
+

Description:::
By default, this text box records the operating system, release, and architecture of the system when it first registers.
Edit this information to include anything you like.

The remaining fields record the physical address at which the system is stored.
To confirm any changes to these fields, click the btn:[Update Properties] button.


[NOTE]
.Setting Properties for Multiple Systems
====
Many of these properties can be set for multiple systems in one go via the System Set Manager interface.
For details, see <<ref.webui.systems.ssm>>.
====



[[s5-sm-system-details-remote]]
==== System Details >  Details  >  Remote Command

This subtab allows you to run remote commands on the selected system. Before doing so, you must first configure the system to accept such commands.

image::system_details_traditional_edit.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. On {slea} clients, subscribe the system to the {susemgr} Tools child channel.
Then use Zypper to install the [command]``rhncfg``, [command]``rhncfg-client``, and [command]``rhncfg-actions`` packages, if not already installed:
+

----
zypper in rhncfg rhncfg-client rhncfg-actions
----
+

On {rhela} clients, subscribe the system to the Tools child channel.
Then use [command]``up2date`` or [command]``yum`` to install the [command]``rhncfg``, [command]``rhncfg-client``, and [command]``rhncfg-actions`` packages, if not already installed:
+

----
yum install rhncfg rhncfg-client rhncfg-actions
----

. Log in to the system as root and add the following file to the local {susemgr} configuration directory: [path]``allowed-actions/scripts/run`` .
+

* Create the necessary directory on the target system:
+

----
mkdir -p /etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/script
----
+

* Create an empty [path]``run`` file in that directory to act as a flag to {susemgr} , signaling permission to allow remote commands:
+

----
touch /etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/script/run
----

When the setup is complete, refresh the page to view the text boxes for remote commands.
Identify a specific user, group, and timeout period, and the script to run.
Select a date and time to execute the command, then click btn:[Schedule] or add the remote command to an action chain.
For further information on action chains, see:
// TODO Update Github Link
<<ref.webui.schedule.chains>>.



[[s5-sm-system-details-react]]
==== System Details >  Details  >  Reactivation  [Management]

Reactivation keys include this system's ID, history, groups, and channels.
This key can then be used only once with the [command]``rhnreg_ks`` command line utility to re-register this system and regain all {susemgr} settings.
Unlike typical activation keys, which are not associated with a specific system ID, keys created here do not show up within the menu:Main Menu[Systems > Activation Keys] page.

image::system_details_reactivation.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Reactivation keys can be combined with activation keys to aggregate the settings of multiple keys for a single system profile.
For example:

----
rhnreg_ks --server=`server-url`\
  --activationkey=`reactivation-key`,`activationkey`--force
----

[WARNING]
====
When autoinstalling a system with its existing {susemgr} profile, the profile uses the system-specific activation key created here to re-register the system and return its other {susemgr} settings.
For this reason, you should not regenerate, delete, or use this key (with [command]``rhnreg_ks``) while a profile-based autoinstallation is in progress.
If you do, the autoinstallation will fail.
====



[[s5-sm-system-details-hardware]]

[[s5-sm-system-details-sp-migration]]
==== System Details >  Software  >  SP Migration

Service Pack Migration (SP Migration) allows you to upgrade a system from one service pack to another.

image::system_details_traditional_software_sp_migration.png[scaledwidth=80%]

[WARNING]
====
During migration {susemgr} automatically accepts any required licenses (EULAs) before installation.
====

Beginning with SLE 12 {suse} supports service pack skipping, it is now possible to migrate from for example, SLE 12 to SLE 12 SP2.
Note that SLE 11 may only be migrated step by step and individual service packs should not be skipped.
Supported migrations include any of the following:

* SLE 11 > SLE 11 SP1 > SLE 11 SP2 > SLE 11 SP3 > SLE 11 SP4
* SLE 12 > SLE 12 SP1 > SLE 12 SP2
* SLE 12 > SLE 12 SP2 (skipping SLE 12 SP1)



[WARNING]
.Migrating from an Earlier Version of SLES
====
It is not possible to migrate, for example, from SLE 11 to SLE 12 using this tool.
You must use autoYaST to perform a migration on this level.
====


[WARNING]
.Rollback Not Possible
====
The migration feature does not cover any rollback functionality.
When the migration procedure is started, rolling back is not possible.
Therefore it is recommended to have a working system backup available for an emergency.
====

[[s5-sm-system-details-channels-config]]
=== System Details >  Configuration  [Management]

This tab and its subtabs assist in managing the configuration files associated with the system.
These configuration files may be managed solely for the current system or distributed widely via a Configuration Channel.
The following sections describe these and other available options on the menu:System Details[Configuration] subtabs.

[NOTE]
====
To manage the configuration of a system, it must have the latest [package]#rhncfg*# packages installed.
Refer to <<ref.webui.config.preparing>> for instructions on enabling and disabling scheduled actions for a system.
====

This section is available to normal users with access to systems that have configuration management enabled.
Like software channels, configuration channels store files to be installed on systems.
While software updates are provided by SCC, configuration files are managed solely by you.
Also unlike with software packages, various versions of configuration files may prove useful to a system at any time.
Only the latest version can be deployed.



[[s5-sdc-configuration-overview]]
==== System Details  >  Configuration  >  Overview

This subtab provides access to the configuration files of your system and to the most common tasks used to manage configuration files.

Configuration Overview::
From the menu:System Details[Configuration > Overview], click the btn:[Add] links to add files, directories, or symbolic links.
Here you also find shortcuts to perform any of the common configuration management tasks listed on the right of the screen by clicking one of the links under menu:System Details[Configuration > Overview > Configuration Actions].

[[s5-sdc-configuration-mngfiles]]
==== System Details >  Configuration  >  View/Modify Files

This subtab lists all configuration files currently associated with the system.
These are sorted via subtabs in centrally and locally managed files and a local sandbox for files under development.

Using the appropriate buttons on a subtab, you can copy from one to the other subtabs.

Centrally-Managed Files::
Centrally-managed configuration files are provided by global configuration channels.
Determine which channel provides which file by examining the menu:Configuration[View/Modify Files > Centrally-Managed Files > Provided By] column below.
Some of these centrally-managed files may be overridden by locally-managed files.
Check the menu:Configuration[View/Modify Files > Centrally-Managed Files > Overridden By] column to find out if any files are overridden, or click btn:[Override this file] to provide such an overriding file.

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_view_mod_central_paths.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Locally-Managed Files::
Locally-managed configuration files are useful for overriding centrally-managed configuration profiles that cause problems on particular systems.
Also, locally-managed configuration files are a method by which system group administrators who do not have configuration administration privileges can manage configuration files on the machines they can manage.

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_view_mod_local_paths.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Local Sandbox::
In the sandbox you can store configuration files under development.
You can promote files from the sandbox to a centrally-managed configuration channel using menu:Configuration Overview[Local Sandbox > Copy Latest to Central Channel].
After files in this sandbox have been promoted to a centrally-managed configuration channel, you can deploy them to other systems.

Use menu:Configuration Overview[Copy Latest to System Channel] to install a configuration on the local system only.
When done, the file will end up on the menu:Configuration Overview[Locally-Managed Files] subtab.

==== System Details >  Configuration  >  Deploy Files

Under menu:Deploy Files[] you find all files that can be deployed on the selected system.

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_deploy_file.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Files from configuration channels with a higher priority take precedence over files from configuration channels with a lower priority.



[[s5-sdc-configuration-diff]]
==== System Details >  Configuration  >  Compare Files

This subtab compares a configuration file stored on the {susemgr} with the file stored on the client.
It does not compare versions of the same file stored in different channels.

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_diff_file.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Select the files to be compared, click the menu:Compare Files[] button, select a time to perform the diff, and click the menu:Schedule Compare[] button to confirm.

To watch progress, see <<s4-sm-system-details-events>>.
After the diff has been performed, go to menu:Recent Events[] in <<s5-sdc-configuration-overview>> to see the results.



[[s5-sdc-configuration-channels]]
==== System Details  >  Configuration  >  Manage Configuration Channels

This subtab allows you to subscribe to and rank configuration channels associated with the system, lowest first.

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_config_channel_list.png[scaledwidth=80%]

The menu:List/Unsubscribe from Channels[] subtab contains a list of the system's configuration channel subscriptions.
Click the check box next to the Channel and click menu:Unsubscribe[] to remove the subscription to the channel.

The menu:Subscribe to Channels[] subtab lists all available configuration channels.

The menu:View/Modify Rankings[] page automatically loads.

The menu:View/Modify Rankings[] subtab allows users to set the priority with which files from a particular configuration channel are ranked.
The higher the channel is on the list, the more its files take precedence over files on lower-ranked channels.
For example, the higher-ranked channel may have an [path]``httpd.conf`` file that will take precedence over the same file in a lower-ranked channel.



[[s4-sm-system-details-kick]]
=== System Details >  Provisioning  [Management]

The menu:Provisioning[] tab and its subtabs allow you to schedule and monitor AutoYaST or Kickstart installations and to restore a system to its previous state.

[NOTE]
.Available for Clients Using the "`Traditional`"Method
====
The note menu:Provisioning[] tab will be available when adding a client using the "`traditional`" method (system type ``management``). Using Salt the menu:Provisioning[] tab will not be available (system type ``salt``).
====

{ay} is a {sle} and Kickstart is a Red Hat utility - both allow you to automate the reinstallation of a system.
Snapshot rollbacks provide the ability to revert certain changes on the system.
You can roll back a set of RPM packages, but rolling back across multiple update levels is not supported.
Both features are described in the sections that follow.



[[s5-sdc-provisioning-kickstart]]
==== System Details  >  Provisioning  >  Autoinstallation

The menu:Schedule[] subtab allows you to configure and schedule an autoinstallation for this system.
For background information about autoinstallation, see <<ref.webui.systems.autoinst>>.

image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_schedule_wizard.png[scaledwidth=80%]

In the menu:Schedule[] subtab, schedule the selected system for autoinstallation.
Choose from the list of available profiles.

[NOTE]
====
You must first create a profile before it appears on this subtab.
If you have not created any profiles, refer to <<ref.webui.systems.autoinst.profiles.create>> before scheduling an autoinstallation for a system.
====

To alter autoinstallation settings, click the menu:Advanced Configuration[] button.
Configure the network connection and post-installation networking information.
You can aggregate multiple network interfaces into a single logical "bonded" interface.
In menu:Kernel Options[] specify kernel options to be used during autoinstallation. menu:Post Kernel Options[] are used after the installation is complete and the system is booting for the first time.
Configure package profile synchronization.

Select a time for the autoinstallation to begin and click menu:Schedule Autoinstall and Finish[] for all changes to take effect and to schedule the autoinstallation.

Alternatively, click menu:Create PXE Installation Configuration[] to create a Cobbler system record.
The selected autoinstallation profile will be used to automatically install the configured distribution next time that particular system boots from PXE.
In this case {susemgr} and its network must be properly configured to allow boot using PXE.

[NOTE]
====
Any settings changed on the menu:Advanced Configuration[] page will be ignored when creating a PXE installation configuration for Cobbler.
====


The menu:Variables[] subtab can be used to create Kickstart variables, which substitute values in Kickstart files.
To define a variable, create a name-value pair ([replaceable]``name/value``) in the text box.

For example, to {kickstart} a system that joins the network of a specific organization (for example the Engineering department) you can create a profile variable to set the IP address and the gateway server address to a variable that any system using that profile will use.
Add the following line to the menu:Variables[] text box:

----
IPADDR=192.168.0.28
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
----

To use the system variable, use the name of the variable in the profile instead of the value.
For example, the [option]``network`` portion of a {kickstart} file could look like the following:

----
network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$IPADDR \
  --gateway=$GATEWAY
----

The [option]``$IPADDR`` will be ``192.168.0.28``, and the [option]``$GATEWAY`` will be ``192.168.0.1``.

[NOTE]
====
There is a hierarchy when creating and using variables in {kickstart} files.
System {kickstart} variables take precedence over profile variables, which in turn take precedence over distribution variables.
Understanding this hierarchy can alleviate confusion when using variables in {kickstart}.
====

Using variables are one part of the larger Cobbler infrastructure for creating templates that can be shared between multiple profiles and systems.
For more information about Cobbler and {kickstart} templates, refer to <<advanced.topics.cobbler>>.

[[s5-sdc-provisioning-powermgnt]]
==== System Details  >  Provisioning  >  Power Management

{susemgr} allows you to power on, off, and reboot systems via the IPMI protocol if the systems are IPMI-enabled.

image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_power_management.png[scaledwidth=80%]

You need a fully patched {susemgr} installation.
To use any power management functionality, IPMI configuration details must be added to {susemgr}.
First select the target system on the systems list, then select menu:Provisioning[Power Management].
On the displayed configuration page, edit all required fields (marked with a red asterisk) and click menu:Save[].

Systems can be powered on, off, or rebooted from the configuration page via corresponding buttons.
Note that any configuration change is also saved in the process.
The menu:Save and Get Status[] button can also be used to query for the system's power state.
If configuration details are correct, a row is displayed with the current power status ("on" or "off").
If a power management operation succeeds on a system, it will also be noted in its menu:Events[History] subtab.

Power management functionalities can also be used from the system set manager to operate on multiple systems at the same time.
Specifically, you can change power management configuration parameters or apply operations (power on, off, reboot) to multiple systems at once:

. Add the respective systems to the system set manager as described in <<ref.webui.systems.ssm>>.
. Click menu:Manage[] (in the upper right corner), then menu: Provisioning[Power Management Configuration] to change one or more configuration parameters for all systems in the set. Note that any field left blank will not alter the configuration parameter in selected systems.
. When all configuration parameters are set correctly, click menu:Manage[] , then menu:Provisioning[Power Management Operations] to power on, off or reboot systems from the set.

To check that a power operation was executed correctly, click menu:System Set Manager[Status]
 on the left-hand menu, then click the proper line in the list.
This will display a new list with systems to which the operation was applied.
If errors prevent correct execution, a brief message with an explanation will be displayed in the menu:Note[]
 column.

This feature uses Cobbler power management, thus a Cobbler system record is automatically created at first use if it does not exist already.
In that case, the automatically created system record will not be bootable from the network and will reference a dummy image.
This is needed because Cobbler does not currently support system records without profiles or images.
The current implementation of Cobbler power management uses the fence-agent tools to support multiple protocols besides IPMI.
Those are not supported by {susemgr}
but can be used by adding the fence agent names as a comma-separated list to the [command]``java.power_management.types`` configuration parameter.

[[s4-sm-system-details-shots]]
==== System Details  >  Provisioning  >  Snapshots


Snapshots enable you to roll back the system's package profile, configuration files, and {susemgr}
settings.


image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_snapshot_index.png[scaledwidth=80%]


Snapshots are always captured automatically after an action takes place.
The menu:Snapshots[]
 subtab lists all snapshots for the system, including the reason the snapshot was taken, the time it was taken, and the number of tags applied to each snapshot.

.Technical Details
[NOTE]
====
* A snapshot is always taken _after_ a successful operation and not before, as you might expect. One consequence of taking snapshots after the action is that, to undo action number X, then you must roll back to the snapshot number X-1.
* It is possible to disable snapshotting globally (in [path]``rhn.conf`` set ``enable_snapshots = 0``), but it is enabled by default. No further fine tuning is possible.

====


To revert to a previous configuration, click the menu:Reason[]
 for the snapshot and review the potential changes on the provided subtabs, starting with menu:Rollback[]
.

.Unsupported Rollback Scenarios
[IMPORTANT]
====
Snapshot roll backs support the ability to revert _certain_ changes to the system, but not in every scenario.
For example, you can roll back a set of RPM packages, but rolling back across multiple update levels is not supported.

Rolling back an SP migration is also not supported.
====


Each subtab provides the specific changes that will be made to the system during the rollback:

* group memberships,
* channel subscriptions,
* installed packages,
* configuration channel subscriptions,
* configuration files,
* snapshot tags.


When satisfied with the reversion, return to the menu:Rollback[]
 subtab and click the menu:Rollback to Snapshot[]
 button.
To see the list again, click menu:Return to snapshot list[]
.


[NOTE]
.Background Information About Snapshots
====
There is no maximum number of snapshots that {susemgr} will keep, thus related database tables will grow with system count, package count, channel count, and the number of configuration changes over time.
Installations with more than a thousand systems should consider setting up a recurring cleanup script via the API or disabling this feature altogether.

There is currently no integrated support for "`rotated snapshots`".

Snapshot rollback gets scheduled like any other action, this means the rollback usually does not happen immediately.
====

[[s5-sm-system-details-shots-tags]]
==== System Details >  Provisioning  >  Snapshot Tags

Snapshot tags provide a means to add meaningful descriptions to your most recent system snapshot.
This can be used to indicate milestones, such as a known working configuration or a successful upgrade.

To tag the most recent snapshot, click menu:Create System Tag[]
, enter a descriptive term in the menu:Tag name[]
 field, and click the menu:Tag Current Snapshot[]
 button.
You may then revert using this tag directly by clicking its name in the Snapshot Tags list.
To delete tags, select their check boxes, click menu:Remove Tags[]
, and confirm the action.

[[s4-sm-system-details-virtualization]]
=== System Details >  Virtualization  [Management]


This tab allows you to create new virtual guests, apply images on a
traditionally managed host system, or change the status of virtual guests.


image::system_details_traditional_virtualization_details.png[scaledwidth=80%]

The menu:Virtualization[]
 tab has three subtabs, menu:Details[],
 menu:Provisioning[], and menu:Deployment[]
.
These tabs appear the same for both virtual hosts and guests, but the functionality only makes sense for virtual hosts.
It is not possible to create a guest system that runs on another guest system.

[float]
[[sdc-virt-host-place]]
==== System Details > Virtualization> Details

menu:Details[]
 is the default tab.
For host systems, it presents a table of the host system's virtual guests.
For each guest system, the following information is provided:

menu:Status[]::
This field indicates whether the virtual system is running, paused, stopped, or has crashed.

menu:Updates[]::
This field indicates whether patches (errata) applicable to the guest have yet to be applied.

menu:Base Software Channel[]::
This field indicates the Base Channel to which the guest is subscribed.


[NOTE]
====
If a guest system has not registered with {susemgr}
, this information appears as plain text in the table.
====


If you have System Group Administrator responsibilities assigned for your guest systems, a user might see the message menu:You do not have permission to access this system[]
 in the table.
This is because it is possible to assign virtual guests on a single host to multiple System Group Administrators.
Only users that have System Group Administrator privileges on the host system may create new virtual guests.



[[s5-sm-system-details-virtualization-deployment]]
==== System Details > Virtualization > Deployment

In the menu:System Details[Virtualization] tab of a traditionally registered bare-metal machine, there is a  menu:System Details[Virtualization > Deployment] subtab.

[[s3-sm-system-keys-manage]]
=== Managing Activation Keys

From the menu:Activation Key[] page organize activation keys for channel management.

image::systems_activation_keys.png[scaledwidth=80%]

To create an activation key:

[[pro.ref.manager.activationkey]]
.Procedure: Creating Activation Keys
. Select menu:Systems[Activation Keys] from the left bar.
. Click the menu:Create Key[] link at the upper right corner.
. menu:Description[] -- Enter a menu:Description[] to identify the generated activation key.
. menu:Key[] -- Either choose automatic generation by leaving this field blank or enter the key you want to generate in the menu:Key[] field. This string of characters can then be used with [command]``rhnreg_ks`` to register client systems with {susemgr} . Refer to <<s3-sm-system-keys-multiple>> for details.
+
.Allowed Characters
WARNING:
ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2011-03-24 - ke: bwiedemann 20110210: # wirklich alle? auch "'\ und
        0 bytes? Also see the quick starts! 2016-02-17 - moio: ," are not allowed <> (){} will
        get removed automatically #
endif::showremarks[]

Do not insert commas or double quotes in the key.
All other characters are allowed, but `<> (){}` (this includes the space) will get removed automatically.
If the string is empty, a random one is generated.

Commas are problematic because they are used as separator when two or more activation keys are used at once.
+

. menu:Usage[] -- The maximum number systems that can be registered with the activation key concurrently. Leave blank for unlimited use. Deleting a system profile reduces the usage count by one and registering a system profile with the key increases the usage count by one.
. menu:Base Channels[] -- The primary channel for the key. This can be either the `{susemgr} Default` channel, a {suse} provided channel, or a custom base channel.
+
Selecting `{susemgr}
Default` allows client systems to register with the {suse}
-provided default channel that corresponds with their installed version of {sle}
.
You can also associate the key with a custom base channel.
If a system using this key is not compatible with the selected channel, it will fall back to the {susemgr}
default channel.
. menu:Add-on System Types[] -- The supplemental system types for the key, e.{nbsp} g. Virtualization Host. All systems will receive these system types with the key.
. menu:Contact Method[] - Select how clients communicate with {susemgr} . menu:Default[] (Pull) waits for the client to check in. With menu:Push via SSH[] and menu:Push via SSH tunnel[] the server contacts the client via SSH (with or without tunnel) and pushes updates and actions, etc.
+
For more information about contact methods, see <<bp.systems.management>>.
. menu:Universal Default[] -- Select whether this key should be considered the primary activation key for your organization.
+
.Changing the Default Activation Key
WARNING: Only one universal default activation key can be defined per organization.
If a universal key already exists for this organization, you will unset the currently used universal key by activating the check box.
+

. Click menu:Create Activation Key[] .


To create more activation keys, repeat the steps above.

After creating the unique key, it appears in the list of activation keys along with the number of times it has been used.
Only Activation Key Administrators can see this list.
At this point, you can configure the key further, for example, associate the key with child channels (for example, the Tools child channel), packages (for example, the [package]#rhncfg-actions#
 package) and groups.
Systems registered with the key get automatically subscribed to them.

To change the settings of a key, click the key's description in the list to display its menu:Details[]
 page. Via additional tabs you can select child channels, packages, configuration channels, group membership and view activated systems.
Modify the appropriate tab then click the menu:Update Activation Key[]
 button.
To disassociate channels and groups from a key, deselect them in the respective menus by kbd:[Ctrl]
-clicking their highlighted names.
To remove a key entirely, click the menu:Delete Key[]
 link in the upper right corner of the menu:Details[]
 page.
In the upper right corner find also the menu:Clone Key[]
 link.

image::systems_activation_key_details.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Any (client tools) package installation requires that the Client Tools channel is available and the menu:Provisioning[]
 check box is selected.
The Client Tools channel should be selected in the menu:Child Channels[]
 tab.

After creating the activation key, you can see in the menu:Details[]
 tab a check box named menu:Configuration File Deployment[]
.
If you select it, all needed packages are automatically added to the menu:Packages[]
 list.
By default, the following packages are added: [package]#rhncfg#
, [package]#rhncfg-client#
, and [package]#rhncfg-actions#
.

If you select menu:Virtualization Host[]
 you automatically get the following package: [package]#rhn-virtualization-host#
.

Adding the [package]#osad#
 package makes sense to execute scheduled actions immediately after the schedule time.
When the activation key is created, you can add packages with selecting the key (menu:Software[Activation Keys]
), then on the activation key details tab, go for the menu:Packages[]
 subtab and add [package]#osad#
.

To disable system activations with a key, uncheck the corresponding box in the menu:Enabled[]
 column in the key list.
The key can be re-enabled by selecting the check box.
Click the menu:Update Activation Keys[]
 button on the bottom right-hand corner of the page to apply your changes.

[[s3-sm-system-keys-multiple]]
=== Using Multiple Activation Keys at Once


Multiple activation keys can be specified at the command line or in a single autoinstallation profile.
This allows you to aggregate the aspects of various keys without re-creating a specific key for every system that you want to register, simplifying the registration and autoinstallation processes while slowing the growth of your key list.
Separate keys with a comma at the command line with [command]``rhnreg_ks`` or in a {kickstart}
 profile in the menu:Activation Keys[]
 tab of the menu:Autoinstallation Details[]
 page.

Registering with multiple activation keys requires some caution.
Conflicts between some values cause registration to fail.
Conflicts in the following values do not cause registration to fail, a combination of values is applied: software packages, software child channels, and configuration channels.
Conflicts in the remaining properties are resolved in the following manner:

* Base software channels: registration fails.
* System types: registration fails.
* Enable configuration flag: configuration management is set.


Do not use system-specific activation keys along with other activation keys; registration fails in this event.

You are now ready to use multiple activation keys at once.

[[ref.webui.systems.profiles]]
== Stored Profiles

(((Web Interface,stored profiles)))

{susemgr}
Provisioning customers can create package profiles via the menu:System Details[]
 page.


image::systems_stored_profiles.png[scaledwidth=80%]


Under menu:Software[Packages > Profiles]
, click menu:Create System Profile[]
.
Enter a menu:Profile Name[]
 and menu:Profile Description[]
, then click menu:Create Profile[]
.
These profiles are displayed on the menu:Stored Profiles[]
 page (left navigation bar), where they can be edited or deleted.

To edit a profile, click its name in the list, alter its name or description, and click the menu:Update[]
 button.
To view software associated with the profile, click the menu:Packages[]
 subtab.
To remove the profile entirely, click menu:Delete Profile[]
 at the upper-right corner of the page.


[[ref.webui.systems.cust-info]]
== Custom System Info

{susemgr}
customers may include completely customizable information about their systems.


image::systems_custom_system_info.png[scaledwidth=80%]


Unlike with notes, the information here is more formal and can be searched.
for example, you may decide to specify an asset tag for each system.
To do so, select menu:Custom System Info[]
 from the left navigation bar and create an `asset` key.

Click menu:Create Key[]
 in the upper-right corner of the page.
Enter a suitable label and description, such as `Asset` and ``Precise location of each system``, then click menu:Create Key[]
.
The key will show up in the custom info keys list.

When the key exists, you may assign a value to it through the menu:Custom Info[]
 tab of the menu:System Details[]
 page.

[[ref.webui.systems.virt-host-managers]]
== Virtual Host Managers


Third party hypervisors and hypervisor managers such as VMWare vCenter are called "`Virtual Host Managers`"
 (VHM) within {susemgr}
.
These managers can manage one or multiple virtual hosts, which in turn may contain virtual guests. {susemgr}
 ships with a tool called [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` that can connect to VHMs using their API, and request information about virtual hosts.
This tool is automatically invoked via Taskomatic nightly, therefore you need to configure your VHMs via XMLRPC APIs. [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` maintains the concept of optional modules, where each module enables a specific Virtual Host Manager.

Proceed to menu:Systems[Virtual Host
   Managers]
 page in the {webui}
 to begin working with a Virtual Host Manager.
In the upper right you can click menu:Create[]
 and select either menu:VMware-based[]
 or menu:File-based[]
.

[[ref.webui.systems.virt-host-managers.vmware]]
=== VMware-Based


After selecting menu:Create[VMware-based]
 enter the location of your VMware-based virtual host.
Enter a menu:Label[]
, menu:Hostname[]
, menu:Port[]
, menu:Username[]
 and menu:Password[]
.
Finally click the menu:Add Virtual Host Manager[]
 button.
For detailed information on working with a VMware-based Virtual Host Manager, see <<advanced.topics.adding.vmware.esxi.host>>.


image::systems_virtual_host_managers_vmware.png[scaledwidth=80%]


[[ref.webui.systems.virt-host-managers.file]]
=== File-Based

In a VMWare environment where direct connection to the SUSE Manager Server is not possible, a JSON file can be exported from the ESXi or vSphere host and later imported into SUSE Manager via this option.

After selecting menu:Create[File-Based]
 enter a label and URL leading to the location of this file.


image::systems_virtual_host_managers_file.png[scaledwidth=80%]


.VMWare vCenter Installations without Direct Access
[NOTE]
====
The file-based is not meant to be used with manually crafted files.
It only meant to be used with the output of [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` against some other module.
File-based is suitable for VMWare vCenter installations for which no direct API access is possible from the SUSE Manager Server.

The solution is to run [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` from somewhere else in the network and save the produced JSON data for further processing.
