Only Configuration Administrators or {susemgr}
Administrators see the menu:Configuration[]
 pages. 

On this configuration pages, manage systems with configuration files, channels offering configuration files, and configartion files themselves.
Centrally-managed files are available to multiple systems; locally-managed files are available to individual systems only. 

.Differences of System Types
[NOTE]
====
Configuration Managment is available for both client system types, traditionally managed clients ([Management]) and Salt minions ([Salt]).  Some traditional features are not suitable for Salt minions, and thus not available and excluded from the {webui}
. 
====

== Configuration Management for Salt


Configuration Management is now enabled for Salt.
The following matrix provides both supported and unsupported configuration management features. 

.Missing {webui}Options
[IMPORTANT]
====
Several {webui}
tabs will be missing for Salt Configuration Management.
These features are not suitable for Salt minions.

== Preparing Systems for Configuration Management [Management]

(((changing email address,system preparation)))


To manage a traditional client's configuration with {susemgr}
, it must have the appropriate tools and the [path]``config-enable``
 file installed.
These tools will be available if you installed the system with the configuration management functionality using {ay}
 or Kickstart.
If not, they can be found in the Tools child channel for your distribution.
Download and install the latest [path]``rhncfg*``
 packages: 

* [path]``rhncfg`` -- the base libraries and functions needed by all [path]``rhncfg-*`` packages, 
* [path]``rhncfg-actions`` -- the RPM package required to run configuration actions scheduled via {susemgr} , 
* [path]``rhncfg-client`` -- the RPM package with a command line interface to the client features of the Configuration Management system, 
* [path]``rhncfg-management`` -- the RPM package with a command line interface used to manage {susemgr} configuration. 


Installation of these packages can also be accomplished during bootstrapping if you enable menu:Configuration File Deployment[]
 on the menu:Details[]
 page of the activation key after creating that activation key.
For more information about activation keys, see <<_s3_sm_system_keys_manage>>. 

[[_ref.webui.config.overview]]

page for the specified system. 

[[_ref.webui.config.channels]]
== Configuration Channels

(((actions,create)))


As mentioned above, {susemgr}
manages both central and local configuration channels and files.
Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems (both traditional clients ([Management]) and Salt minions ([Salt])). Local configuration management is available for traditional clients ([Management]) only and allows you to specify overrides or configuration files that are not changed by subscribing the system to a central channel. 

A "`state channel`"
 is a type of a configuration channel but for Salt minion only.
For a state channel, the [path]``init.sls``
 file is not auto-generated, the user creates and edits it.
Additionally, state channels can contain arbitrary configuration files that could be referenced from within the [path]``init.sls``
 file.
Therefore, state channels effectively replace custom states. 

.Referencing Configuration Files with Organization ID
[NOTE]
====
You must reference configuration files with the `salt://` prefix, the organization ID, and the channel name.
For example, to reference [path]``/etc/motd``
 use: 

----
file.managed:
  - source: salt://manager_org_1/`channel_name`
/etc/motd
----
====


Central configuration or state channels must be created via the links on this page. 

Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel.
If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the menu:List/Remove Files[]
 page of that channel.
If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the menu:Systems[Subscribed
   Systems]
 page for that channel.

[[_ref.webui.config.files]]
== Configuration Files


This page allows you to manage your configuration files independently.
Both centrally-managed and locally-managed files can be reached from sub-pages. 

.Maximum Size for Configuration Files
[NOTE]
====
By default, the maximum file size for configuration files is 128 KB (131072 bytes). {suse}
supports a configuration file size up to 1 MB; larger values are not guaranteed to work. 
====


ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2010-12-21 - ke: will "rhn" stay here? 2010-12-28 - kkaempf: "rhn" will
    stay here. #
endif::showremarks[]

To change the file size limit, edit all the following files on the {susemgr}
 server and edit or add the following variables: 

----
# /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_web.conf
web.maximum_config_file_size = 262144

# /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_server.conf

[[_configuration_files_central]]
=== Centrally-Managed Files


Centrally-managed files are available to multiple systems.
Changing a file within a centrally-managed channel may result in changes to several systems.
Locally-managed files supersede centrally-managed files.
For more information about locally-managed files, see <<_configuration_files_local>>. 

This page lists all files currently stored in your central configuration channel.
Click the menu:Path[]
 of a file to see its menu:Details[]
 tab.
Click the name of the menu:Configuration Channel[]
 to see the channel's menu:Overview[]
 tab.
Clicking menu:Systems Subscribed[]
 shows you all systems currently subscribed to the channel containing that file.
Click menu:Systems Overriding[]
 to see all systems that have a local (or override) version of the configuration file.
The centrally-managed file will not be deployed to those systems. 

[[_configuration_files_local]]
=== Locally-Managed Files [Management]


Locally-managed configuration files apply to only one system.
They may be files in the system's sandbox or files that can be deployed to the system at any time.
Local files have higher priority than centrally-managed files.
If a system is subscribed to a configuration channel with a given file and additionally has a locally-managed version of that file, the locally-managed version will be deployed. 

The list of all local (override) configuration files for your systems includes the local configuration channels and the sandbox channel for each Provisioning-entitled system. 

Click the menu:Path[]
 of the file to see its menu:Config File Details[]
.
Click the name of the system to which it belongs to see its menu:System Details[Configuration > Overview]
 page. 

[[_s3_sm_file_macros]]
=== Including Macros in your Configuration Files

(((within configuration Files,interpolation)))


Being able to store one file and share identical configurations is useful, but what if you have many variations of the same configuration file? What do you do if you have configuration files that differ only in system-specific details, such as host name and MAC address? 

Traditional file management would require to upload and distribute each file separately, even if the distinction is nominal and the number of variations is in the hundreds or thousands. {susemgr}
addresses this by allowing the inclusion of macros, or variables, within the configuration files it manages.
In addition to variables for custom system information, the following standard macros are supported: 
ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2010-12-21 - ke: will "rhn" stay here? 2010-12-28 - ke: see bug
    660807#c3 #
endif::showremarks[]


----
rhn.system.sid
rhn.system.profile_name
rhn.system.description
rhn.system.hostname
rhn.system.ip_address
rhn.system.custom_info(key_name)
rhn.system.net_interface.ip_address(eth_device)
rhn.system.net_interface.netmask(eth_device)
rhn.system.net_interface.broadcast(eth_device)
rhn.system.net_interface.hardware_address(eth_device)
rhn.system.net_interface.driver_module(eth_device)
----


To use this powerful feature, either upload or create a configuration file via the menu:Configuration Channel Details[]
 page.
Then open its menu:Configuration File Details[]
 page and include the supported macros of your choice.
Ensure that the delimiters used to offset your variables match those set in the menu:Macro Start Delimiter[]
 and menu:Macro End Delimiter[]
 fields and do not conflict with other characters in the file.
We recommend that the delimiters be two characters in length and must not contain the percent (``%``) symbol. 

For example, you may have a file applicable to all of your servers that differs only in IP address and host name.
Rather than manage a separate configuration file for each server, you may create a single file, such as [path]``server.conf``
, with the IP address and host name macros included. 

----
hostname={| rhn.system.hostname |}
ip_address={| rhn.system.net_interface.ip_address(eth0) |}
----


ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2010-12-21 - ke: will "rhn" stay here? #
endif::showremarks[]

Upon delivery of the file to individual systems, whether through a scheduled action in the {susemgr}
 Web interface or at the command line with the {susemgr}
 Configuration Client ([command]``mgrcfg-client``), the variables will be replaced with the host name and IP address of the system as recorded in {susemgr}
's system profile.
In the above example configuration file the deployed version resembles the following: 

----
hostname=test.example.domain.com
ip_address=177.18.54.7
----


To capture custom system information, insert the key label into the custom information macro (``rhn.system.custom_info``). For example, if you developed a key labeled "``asset``" you can add it to the custom information macro in a configuration file to have the value substituted on any system containing it.
The macro would look like this: 

----
asset={@ rhn.system.custom_info(asset) @}
----


When the file is deployed to a system containing a value for that key, the macro gets translated, resulting in a string similar to the following: 

----
asset=Example#456
----


To include a default value, for example, if one is required to prevent errors, you can append it to the custom information macro, like this: 

----
asset={@ rhn.system.custom_info(asset) = 'Asset #' @}
----


This default is overridden by the value on any system containing it. 

Using the {susemgr}
Configuration Manager ([command]``mgrcfg-manager``) will not translate or alter files, as this tool is system agnostic. [command]``mgrcfg-manager`` does not depend on system settings.
Binary files cannot be interpolated. 

[[_ref.webui.config.systems]]
== Systems


This page displays status information about your system in relation to configuration.
There are two sub-pages: menu:Managed Systems[]
 and menu:Target Systems[]
. 

[[_config_systems_managed]]
=== Managed Systems


By default the menu:Configuration[Managed Systems]
 page is displayed.
The listed systems have been fully prepared for configuration file deployment.
The number of locally- and centrally-managed files is displayed.
Clicking the name of a system shows its menu:System
    Details[Configuration > Overview]
 page.
Clicking the number of local files takes you to the menu:System Details[Configuration > View/Modify Files > Locally-Managed Files]
 page, where you manage which local (override) files apply to the system.
Clicking the number of centrally-managed files takes you to the menu:System Details[Configuration > Manage Configuration Channels > List/Unsubscribe
    from Channels]
 page.
Here you unsubscribe from any channels you want. 

[[_config_systems_target]]
=== Target Systems


Here you see the systems either not prepared for configuration file deployment or not yet subscribed to a configuration channel.
The table has three columns.
The first identifies the system name, the second shows whether the system is prepared for configuration file deployment, and the third lists the steps necessary to prepare the system.
To prepare a system, check the box to the left of the profile name then click the menu:Enable SUSE Manager Configuration Management[]
 button.
All of the preparatory steps that can be automatically performed are scheduled by {susemgr}
. 

[NOTE]
====
You will need to perform some manual tasks to enable configuration file deployment.
Follow the on-screen instructions provided to assist with each step.
