(((Schedule)))

(((WebLogic,Schedule)))

menu:Schedule[]
 on the left navigation menu features pages that enable you to manage the actions carried out on your systems.
An action is a scheduled task to be performed on one or more client systems.
For example, an action can be scheduled to apply all patches to a system.
Actions can also be grouped into action chains to schedule them at the same time in a particular order, for example to reboot a system after deploying patches. 

{susemgr}
keeps track of the following action types: 

* package alteration (installation, upgrade, and removal), 
* rollback package actions, 
* system reboots, 
* patch application, 
* configuration file alteration (deploy, upload, and diff), 
* hardware profile updates, 
* package list profile updates, 
* automated installation initiation, 
* service pack migrations, 
* remote commands. 


Each page in the menu:Schedule[]
 category represents an action status. 

[[_ref.webui.schedule.pending]]
== Pending Actions


The menu:Pending Actions[]
 page appears when clicking menu:Schedule[Pending
   Actions]

or grouped actions{mdash}
for example, in the menu:Software[Packages]
 or menu:Software[Packages]
 subtabs on a system details page (see <<_s4_sm_system_details_errata>> or <<_s4_sm_system_details_packages>>) or in the menu:Configuration[Deploy Files]

In the menu:Action Chain List[]
 you can click the label to view or edit an menu:Action Chain[]
.
In the top right corner is the menu:delete action chain[]
 link.
To add actions to an existing chain, pick up a "`chainable`"
 action (such as running a remote command) from a system details page (see <<_s3_sm_system_details>>.
Then check menu:Add to Action Chain[]
 and select an action chain from the drop-down box.
Confirm with menu:Schedule[]
. 

To create a new action chain, configure the first action, then select menu:Add to Action Chain[]
 instead of menu:Schedule no sooner than[]
.
Click the drop-down box, enter a name, and click menu:Schedule[]
 to save the chain.
Then proceed to the next action and add it to the new chain. 

Action chains can be edited via the menu:Schedule[Action Chains]
 page.
Click a chain name to see the actions in the order they will be performed.
The following tasks can be carried out here: 

* Change the order of actions by dragging the respective action to the right position and dropping it. 
* Delete actions from the chain by clicking the menu:delete action[] link. 
* Inspect the list of systems on which an action is run by clicking the menu:+[] sign. 
* Delete a single system from an action chain by clicking the menu:delete system[] link. 
* Delete the complete action chain with the menu:delete action chain[] link in the top-left corner. 
* Change an action chain label by clicking it. 
* Schedule an action chain for execution on a certain date by clicking the menu:Save and Schedule[] button. 


.Unsaved Changes
[NOTE]
====
If you leave the page without clicking either menu:Save[]
 or menu:Save and Schedule[]
 all unsaved changes will be discarded.
In this case, a confirmation dialog will pop up. 
====


Currently you cannot add an action to an action chain from the menu:Edit[]
 section of the action chain details page.
When a Chain is scheduled, the actions it contains will be displayed under menu:Schedule[]
 on the appropriate pages: menu:Pending Actions[]
, menu:Failed Actions[]
 or menu:Completed Actions[]
, depending on the status.
If one action fails on a system no other actions from the same chain will be executed on that systems.
Because of technical limitations it is not possible to reuse Action Chains.
