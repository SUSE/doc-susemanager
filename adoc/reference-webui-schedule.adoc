menu:Schedule[] helps with managing actions and combining actions to action chains.

menu:Schedule[] is located on the left navigation menu and features pages that enable you to manage the actions carried out on your systems.
An action is a scheduled task to be performed on one or more client systems.
For example, an action can be scheduled to apply all patches to a system.
Actions can also be grouped into action chains to schedule them at the same time in a particular order, for example to reboot a system after deploying patches.

{susemgr}
keeps track of the following action types:

* package alteration (installation, upgrade, and removal),
* rollback package actions,
* system reboots,
* patch application,
* configuration file alteration (deploy, upload, and diff),
* hardware profile updates,
* package list profile updates,
* automated installation initiation,
* service pack migrations,
* remote commands.


Each page in the menu:Schedule[]
 category represents an action status.

[[ref.webui.schedule.pending]]
== Pending Actions


The menu:Pending Actions[]
 page appears when clicking menu:Schedule[Pending Actions]
.
It displays actions not yet started or still in progress.

image::schedule_archived_actions.png[scaledwidth=80%]


[[ref.webui.schedule.chains]]
== Action Chains


You can create action chains{mdash}
or grouped actions{mdash}
for example, in the menu:Software[Packages]
 or menu:Software[Packages]
 subtabs on a system details page (see <<s4-sm-system-details-errata>> or <<s4-sm-system-details-packages>>) or in the menu:Configuration[Deploy Files]
 subtab on a system details page (see <<s5-sdc-configuration-deploy-files>>).

The following list of actions may be added to an action chain.
These actions are supported on both traditional clients and Salt minions.
Schedulable actions are located under a systems, menu:System Details[]
 page on the following subtabs.

.Chainable Actions
* menu:System Details[Remote Command]
* menu:System Details[Schedule System Reboot]
* menu:System Details[States > Highstate]
* menu:System Details[Software > Packages > List/Remove]
* menu:System Details[Software > Packages > Install]
* menu:System Details[Software > Packages > Upgrade]
* menu:System Details[Software > Patches]
* menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels]
* menu:System Details[Configuration]
* menu:Images[Build]



image::schedule_action_chains.png[scaledwidth=80%]


In the menu:Action Chain List[]
 you can click the label to view or edit an menu:Action Chain[]
.
In the top right corner is the menu:delete action chain[]
 link.
To add actions to an existing chain, pick up a "`chainable`"
 action (such as running a remote command) from a system details page (see <<s3-sm-system-details>>.
Then check menu:Add to Action Chain[]
 and select an action chain from the drop-down box.
Confirm with menu:Schedule[]
.

To create a new action chain, configure the first action, then select menu:Add to Action Chain[]
 instead of menu:Schedule no sooner than[]
.
Click the drop-down box, enter a name, and click menu:Schedule[]
 to save the chain.
Then proceed to the next action and add it to the new chain.

Action chains can be edited via the menu:Schedule[Action Chains]
 page.
Click a chain name to see the actions in the order they will be performed.
The following tasks can be carried out here:

* Change the order of actions by dragging the respective action to the right position and dropping it.
* Delete actions from the chain by clicking the menu:delete action[] link.
* Inspect the list of systems on which an action is run by clicking the menu:+[] sign.
* Delete a single system from an action chain by clicking the menu:delete system[] link.
* Delete the complete action chain with the menu:delete action chain[] link in the top-left corner.
* Change an action chain label by clicking it.
* Schedule an action chain for execution on a certain date by clicking the menu:Save and Schedule[] button.


.Unsaved Changes
[NOTE]
====
If you leave the page without clicking either menu:Save[]
 or menu:Save and Schedule[]
 all unsaved changes will be discarded.
In this case, a confirmation dialog will pop up.
====


Currently you cannot add an action to an action chain from the menu:Edit[]
 section of the action chain details page.
When a Chain is scheduled, the actions it contains will be displayed under menu:Schedule[]
 on the appropriate pages: menu:Pending Actions[]
, menu:Failed Actions[]
 or menu:Completed Actions[]
, depending on the status.
If one action fails on a system no other actions from the same chain will be executed on that systems.
Because of technical limitations it is not possible to reuse Action Chains.
