== Introduction

Releases prior to {productname} 2.1 were shipped with a *traditional* client management framework (which is still fully supported today).
SUSE Manager 3 and later include the Salt framework in addition to the *traditional* framework.

Salt::
Is an end-to-end data-center automation tool which may also be used outside the scope of {productname} to introduce reactive, real-time orchestration, and configuration management.
Managed systems can coexist using both *traditional* and *Salt* frameworks.
This functionality provides a safe learning environment when switching to *Salt* while you continue to maintain existing deployments.

[[create.act.keys]]
== Creating Activation Keys

The following procedure will guide you through creating the activation keys for your test channels.
Activation keys can be used with both Salt and traditional clients.

Activation keys define the number of software entitlements, channels, and groups a client system is allowed to subscribe to.
This information is passed on to all systems registered with said key.
Each activation key is bound to the organization for which it has been created.

[[create.activation.keys]]
.Procedure: Creating Activation Keys
. As the administrator login to the {productname} {webui}.
. Switch to menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. Click the btn:[Create Key] link at the upper right corner.
+

image::systems_create_activation_key.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Enter an menu:Activation Key Details[Description] to identify the generated activation key.
. Enter a human readable menu:Activation Key Details[Key] string value such as *SLES12-SP3* to represent the distribution and service pack associated with the key.
+

.Allowed Characters
WARNING: For all {suse}
Products do not use commas within the key string.
Red Hat Products require commas.
For more information, see <<ref.webui.systems.activ-keys>>.
+

. Select the {sle} channel that was added during

ifndef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync#proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync, First Channel Sync>>
endif::[]
from the menu:Activation Key Details[Base Channels] drop down.
. For this guide leave menu:Activation Key Details[Contact Method] set to default.
. menu:Activation Key Details[Universal Default] should remain unchecked. Click btn:[Update Activation Key] to complete creation of the activation key.


[[create.tools.repository]]
== Creating the {productname} Tools Repository

In this section you will create a tools repository on the {productname} Server for providing client tools.
The client tools repository contains packages for installing Salt on minions as well as required packages for registering traditional clients during the bootstrapping procedure.
These packages will be installed from the newly generated repository during the registration process.
In the following procedure you will create the {sle} tools repository.

[IMPORTANT]
.Creating a Tools Repository when an SCC Channel has not been Synced
====
Before following the procedure to create the tools repository make sure the {suse} vendor channel you will be using with your client has been completely synced.
You can check this by running [command]``tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/``<CHANNEL_NAME>``.log`` as _root_.
In the following example replace [replaceable]``version`` with the actual version string:

----
# tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/sles`version`-pool-x86_64.log
----

Once completed you should see the following output in your terminal:

----
2017/12/12 15:20:32 +02:00 Importing packages started.
2017/12/12 15:22:02 +02:00 1.07 %
...
2017/12/12 15:34:25 +02:00 86.01 %
2017/12/12 15:35:49 +02:00 Importing packages finished.
2017/12/12 15:35:49 +02:00 Linking packages to channel.
...
2017/12/12 15:35:59 +02:00 Sync completed.
----
====

.Procedure: Generating the Tools Repository for {sle}
. Open a terminal on the server as root and enter the following command to list available bootstrap repositories:
+

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l SLE-`version`-x86_64
----
. Then invoke the same command using the listed repository as the product label to actually create the bootstrap repository:
+

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-version-x86_64
----
. {productname} will create and add the client tools to the newly created [path]``repositories`` directory located at [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/`` .


This repository is suitable for both Server and Desktop of {sle}
.

[[registering.clients.traditional]]
== Registering Traditional Clients

[[generate.bootstrap.script]]
=== Generating a Bootstrap Script


This section goes over generating a template bootstrap script which will be copied and modified for use with "`traditional`" clients.
Traditional clients register with {productname} via a bootstrap script executed on the client which deploys all necessary packages to it.
The bootstrap script contains parameters which assigns a client system to its base channel.
Two of these important parameters are:

* Activation Keys
* GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) Keys


[NOTE]
.SLES 15 and Python 3
====
SLES 15 utilizes Python 3 by default.  Because of this change any older
bootstrap scripts (based on python 2) must be re-created for SLES 15 systems. Attempting to
register SLES 15 systems with {susemgr} using Python 2 versions of the bootstrap script will
fail.
====

The following procedure will guide you through generating a bootstrap script.

[[create.boot.script]]
.Procedure: Creating a Bootstrap Script
. From the {productname} {webui}, browse to menu:Main Menu[Admin > Manager Configuration > Bootstrap Script]. For more information, see <<s3-sattools-config-bootstrap>>.
. In the [guimenu]``SUSE Manager Configuration - Bootstrap`` dialog disable [guimenu]``Bootstrap using Salt``.
Use default settings and click the btn:[Update] button.
+

image::mgr_configuration_bootstrap_trad.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+

[WARNING]
.Using SSL
====
It is not recommended that you clear the [guimenu]``Enable SSL`` checkbox in the {webui}, or set `USING_SSL=0` in the bootstrap script.
If you disable SSL, the registration process will not complete successfully unless you manage custom CA certificates.
====
+

. A template bootstrap script is generated and stored on the server's file system in the [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap`` directory.
+

----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap
----
+
The bootstrap script is also available at [path]``https://example.com/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh``
.

<<modify.bootstrap.script>> will cover copying and modifying your bootstrap template for use with each client.

[[modify.bootstrap.script]]
=== Editing the Bootstrap Script


In this section you will copy and modify the template bootstrap script you created from <<generate.bootstrap.script>>.

A minimal requirement when modifying a bootstrap script for use with {productname} is the inclusion of an activation key.
Depending on your organizations security requirements it is strongly recommended to include one or more (GPG) keys (for example, your organization key, and package signing keys).
For this tutorial you will be registering with the activation keys created in the previous section.

[[mod.bootstrap.script]]
.Procedure: Modifying the Bootstrap Script
. Login as root from the command line on your {productname} server.
. Navigate to the bootstrap directory with:
+

----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/
----

. Create and rename two copies of the template bootstrap script for use with each of your clients.
+

----
cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles11.sh
cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles12.sh
----

. Open [path]``sles12.sh`` for modification.
Scroll down and modify both lines marked in green.
Comment out `exit 1` with a hash mark (`\#`) to activate the script, then enter the name of the key for this script in the `ACTIVATION_KEYS=` field:
+

----
echo "Enable this script: comment (with #'s) this block (or, at least just"
echo "the exit below)"
echo
#exit 1

# can be edited, but probably correct (unless created during initial install):
# NOTE: ACTIVATION_KEYS *must* be used to bootstrap a client machine.
ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-sles12
ORG_GPG_KEY=
----

. Once you have completed your modifications save the file and repeat this procedure for the second bootstrap script.
Proceed to <<connect.first.client>>.



[NOTE]
.Finding Your Keys
====
To find key names you have created: In the {webui}, click menu:Home[Overview > Manage Activation keys > Key Field].
All keys created for channels are listed on this page.
You must enter the full name of the key you wish to use in the bootstrap script exactly as presented in the key field.
====

[[connect.first.client]]
=== Connecting Clients

This section covers connecting your clients to {productname} with the modified bootstrap script.

[[run.bootstrap.script]]
.Procedure: Running the Bootstrap Script
. From your {productname} Server command line as root navigate to the following directory:
+

----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/
----

. Run the following command to execute the bootstrap script on the client:
+

----
cat MODIFIED-SCRIPT.SH \
| ssh root@example.com /bin/bash
----

. The script will execute and proceed to download the required dependencies located in the repositories directory you created earlier.
Once the script has finished running, log in to the {webui} and click menu:Systems[Overview] to see the new client listed.

This concludes the bootstrap section of this guide. <<preparing.and.registering.clients.salt>> will go over registering Salt minions for use with {productname}.



[[sect.tradclient.packagelock]]
=== Package Locks

Package locks are used to prevent unauthorized installation or upgrades to software packages on traditional clients.
When a package has been locked, it will display to users with a padlock icon, indicating that it can not be installed.
Any attempt to install a locked package will be reported as an error in the event log.

Locked packages can not be installed, upgraded, or removed, either through the {productname} {webui}, or directly on the client machine using a package manager.
Locked packages will also indirectly lock any dependent packages.


[NOTE]
====
Package locks can only be used on traditional clients that use the Zypper package manager.
The feature is not currently supported on {rhel} or Salt clients.
====

.Procedure: Using Package Locks
. On the client machine, install the [package]``zypp-plugin-spacewalk`` package:
+
----
# zypper in zypp-plugin-spacewalk
----

. Navigate to the menu:Software[Packages > Lock] tab on the managed system to see a list of all available packages.
. Select the packages to lock, and click btn:[Request Lock].
You can also choose to enter a date and time for the lock to activate.
Note that even if you do not select a date and time, the lock might not activate immediately.
. To remove a package lock, select the packages to unlock and click btn:[Request Unlock].
You can also choose to enter a date and time for the lock to deactivate.
Note that even if you do not select a date and time, the lock might not deactivate immediately.




[[preparing.and.registering.clients.salt]]
== Registering Salt Clients

There are currently three methods for registering Salt minions.
The following section describes the first method and uses a bootstrap repository.
The second method is to create a bootstrap script using [command]``mgr-bootstrap``.
Bootstrapping Salt minions with [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` is performed in the same manner as bootstrapping traditional clients; for more information, see <<registering.clients.traditional>>.
The third method is performed from the {productname} {webui}; find this method located in <<ref.webui.systems.bootstrapping>>.


The following section assumes you have created a SUSE Manager tools repository.
You can review creating a tools repository in <<create.tools.repository>>.


[WARNING]
.Ensure the Salt Master is Reachable During Bootstrap
====
The Salt master and its proxy should always be reachable via both IP address and the FQDN.
In the following rare scenario:

* The Salt master (SUSE Manager) is in some DNS.
* Your Minions are in a different subnet bound to an alternate DNS and the Salt master record is absent.
* The Salt master cannot know that the minion is not utilizing the same DNS record. The the Salt master nevertheless sends the FQDN of itself to the minion expecting it to join.
* The minion looks for a different DNS, one where the master record does not exist therefore bootstrap fails.

====


Once you have fully synchronized a base channel from the {webui} for clients to obtain software sources (for example: [path]``SLES12-SP3-Pool_for_x86_64``), register a Salt minion:

.Procedure: Registering Salt Minions
. On your minion as {rootuser} enter the following command:
+

----
zypper ar http://`FQDN.SUSE.Manager.com`/pub/repositories/sle/12/3/bootstrap/ \
   sles12-sp3
----
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not use HTTPS.
Use HTTP instead to avoid errors.
====
+

. After adding the repository containing the necessary Salt packages execute:
+

----
zypper in salt-minion
----
. Modify the minion configuration file to point to the fully qualified domain name ([replaceable]``FQDN``) of the {productname} server (master):
+

----
vi /etc/salt/minion
----
+
Find and change the line:
+

----
master: salt
----
+
to:
+

----
master:`FQDN.SUSE.Manager.com`
----
. Restart the Salt minion with:
+

----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----

Your newly registered minion should now show up within the {webui} under menu:Salt[Keys].
Accept the [guimenu]``pending`` key to begin management.

If you have used your hypervisor clone utility, and attempted to register the cloned Salt client, you might get this error:

----
We're sorry, but the system could not be found.
----

This is caused by the new, cloned, system having the same machine ID as an existing, registered, system.
You can adjust this manually to correct the error and register the cloned system successfully.
