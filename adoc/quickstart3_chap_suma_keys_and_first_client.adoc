== Introduction

Releases prior to {susemgr} 2.1 were shipped with a *traditional* client management framework (which is still fully supported today).
SUSE Manager 3 and later include the Salt framework in addition to the *traditional* framework.

Salt::
Is an end-to-end data-center automation tool which may also be used outside the scope of {susemgr} to introduce reactive, real-time orchestration, and configuration management.
Managed systems can coexist using both *traditional* and *Salt* frameworks.
This functionality provides a safe learning environment when switching to *Salt* while you continue to maintain existing deployments.

[[create.act.keys]]
== Creating Activation Keys

The following procedure will guide you through creating the activation keys for your test channels.
Activation keys can be used with both Salt and traditional clients.

Activation keys define the number of software entitlements, channels, and groups a client system is allowed to subscribe to.
This information is passed on to all systems registered with said key.
Each activation key is bound to the organization for which it has been created.

[[create.activation.keys]]
.Procedure: Creating Activation Keys
. As the administrator login to the {susemgr} {webui}.
. Switch to menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. Click the btn:[Create Key] link at the upper right corner.
+

image::systems_create_activation_key.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Enter an menu:Activation Key Details[Description] to identify the generated activation key.
. Enter a human readable menu:Activation Key Details[Key] string value such as *SLES12-SP3* to represent the distribution and service pack associated with the key.
+

.Allowed Characters
WARNING: For all {suse}
Products do not use commas within the key string.
Red Hat Products require commas.
For more information, see <<ref.webui.systems.activ_keys>>.
+

. Select the {sle} channel that was added during

<<quickstart3_chap_sumasetup_with_yast.adoc#gs-syncing-with-scc, Synchronizing with SCC>>
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync#proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync, First Channel Sync>>
endif::[]
from the menu:Activation Key Details[Base Channels] drop down.
. For this guide leave menu:Activation Key Details[Contact Method] set to default.
. menu:Activation Key Details[Universal Default] should remain unchecked. Click btn:[Create Activation Key] to complete creation of the activation key.


[[create.tools.repository]]
== Creating the {susemgr} Tools Repository

In this section you will create a tools repository on the {susemgr} Server for providing client tools.
The client tools repository contains packages for installing Salt on minions as well as required packages for registering traditional clients during the bootstrapping procedure.
These packages will be installed from the newly generated repository during the registration process.
In the following procedure you will create the {sle} tools repository.

[IMPORTANT]
.Creating a Tools Repository when an SCC Channel has not been Synced
====
Before following the procedure to create the tools repository make sure the {suse} vendor channel you will be using with your client has been completely synced.
You can check this by running [command]``tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/``<CHANNEL_NAME>``.log`` as _root_.
In the following example replace [replaceable]``version`` with the actual version string:

----
# tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/sles`version`-pool-x86_64.log
----

Once completed you should see the following output in your terminal:

----
2017/12/12 15:20:32 +02:00 Importing packages started.
2017/12/12 15:22:02 +02:00 1.07 %
...
2017/12/12 15:34:25 +02:00 86.01 %
2017/12/12 15:35:49 +02:00 Importing packages finished.
2017/12/12 15:35:49 +02:00 Linking packages to channel.
...
2017/12/12 15:35:59 +02:00 Sync completed.
----
====

.Procedure: Generating the Tools Repository for {sle}
. Open a terminal on the server as root and enter the following command to list available bootstrap repositories:
+

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l SLE-`version`-x86_64
----
. Then invoke the same command using the listed repository as the product label to actually create the bootstrap repository:
+

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-version-x86_64
----
. {susemgr} will create and add the client tools to the newly created [path]``repositories`` directory located at [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/`` .


This repository is suitable for both Server and Desktop of {sle}
.

[[registering.clients.traditional]]
== Registering Traditional Clients

[[generate.bootstrap.script]]
=== Generating a Bootstrap Script


This section goes over generating a template bootstrap script which will be copied and modified for use with "`traditional`" clients.
Traditional clients register with {susemgr} via a bootstrap script executed on the client which deploys all necessary packages to it.
The bootstrap script contains parameters which assigns a client system to its base channel.
Two of these important parameters are:

* Activation Keys
* GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) Keys


[NOTE]
.Using the --traditional [option]
====
As of {susemgr} 3.1 the [command]``--traditional`` option must be used if creating a bootstrap script from the command line via the [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` command for traditional clients.
Generated bootstrap scripts target Salt minions by default.
====

[NOTE]
.Bootstrap Scripting Best Practices
====
It is possible to use various methods to register clients for use with {susemgr} in mass using bootstrap.
Using batch scripts for mass registration of both VM and Bare Metal machines is a possibility.
Some of these methods will be covered in the [ref]_Best Practices Guide_ and will be added as examples at a later time.
====

The following procedure will guide you through generating a bootstrap script.

[[create.boot.script]]
.Procedure: Creating a Bootstrap Script
. From the {susemgr} {webui}, browse to menu:Main Menu[Admin > Manager Configuration > Bootstrap Script]. For more information, see <<s3-sattools-config-bootstrap>>.
. Uncheck menu:SUSE Manager Configuration - Bootstrap[Bootstrap Script > Bootstrap using Salt].
Use default settings and click the btn:[Update] button.
+

image::mgr_configuration_bootstrap_trad.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+

[WARNING]
.Using SSL
====
Unchecking menu:Enable SSL[] in the {webui} or setting `USING_SSL=0` in the bootstrap script is not recommended.
If you disable SSL nevertheless you will need to manage custom CA certificates to be able to run the registration process successfully.
====
+

. A template bootstrap script is generated and stored on the server's file system in the [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap`` directory.
+

----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap
----
+
The bootstrap script is also available at [path]``https://example.com/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh``
.

<<modify.bootstrap.script>> will cover copying and modifying your bootstrap template for use with each client.

[[modify.bootstrap.script]]
=== Editing the Bootstrap Script


In this section you will copy and modify the template bootstrap script you created from <<generate.bootstrap.script>>.

A minimal requirement when modifying a bootstrap script for use with {susemgr} is the inclusion of an activation key.
Depending on your organizations security requirements it is strongly recommended to include one or more (GPG) keys (for example, your organization key, and package signing keys).
For this tutorial you will be registering with the activation keys created in the previous section.

[[mod.bootstrap.script]]
.Procedure: Modifying the Bootstrap Script
. Login as root from the command line on your {susemgr} server.
. Navigate to the bootstrap directory with:
+

----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/
----

. Create and rename two copies of the template bootstrap script for use with each of your clients.
+

----
cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles11.sh
cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles12.sh
----

. Open [path]``sles12.sh`` for modification.
Scroll down and modify both lines marked in green.
You must comment out `exit 1` with a hash mark (``\#``) to activate the script and then enter the name of the key for this script in the `ACTIVATION_KEYS=` field as follows:
+

----
echo "Enable this script: comment (with #'s) this block (or, at least just"
echo "the exit below)"
echo
#exit 1

# can be edited, but probably correct (unless created during initial install):
# NOTE: ACTIVATION_KEYS *must* be used to bootstrap a client machine.
ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-sles12
ORG_GPG_KEY=
----

. Once you have completed your modifications save the file and repeat this procedure for the second bootstrap script.
Proceed to <<connect.first.client>>.



[NOTE]
.Finding Your Keys
====
To find key names you have created: In the {webui}, click menu:Home[Overview > Manage Activation keys > Key Field].
All keys created for channels are listed on this page.
You must enter the full name of the key you wish to use in the bootstrap script exactly as presented in the key field.
====

[[connect.first.client]]
=== Connecting Clients

This section covers connecting your clients to {susemgr} with the modified bootstrap script.

[[run.bootstrap.script]]
.Procedure: Running the Bootstrap Script
. From your {susemgr} Server command line as root navigate to the following directory:
+

----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/
----

. Run the following command to execute the bootstrap script on the client:
+

----
cat MODIFIED-SCRIPT.SH \
| ssh root@example.com /bin/bash
----

. The script will execute and proceed to download the required dependencies located in the repositories directory you created earlier.
Once the script has finished running, log in to the {webui} and click menu:Systems[Overview] to see the new client listed.

This concludes the bootstrap section of this guide. <<preparing.and.registering.clients.salt>> will go over registering Salt minions for use with {susemgr}.

[[preparing.and.registering.clients.salt]]
== Registering Salt Clients

There are currently three methods for registering Salt minions.
The following section describes the first method and uses a bootstrap repository.
The second method is to create a bootstrap script using [command]``mgr-bootstrap``.
Bootstrapping Salt minions with [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` is performed in the same manner as bootstrapping traditional clients; for more information, see <<registering.clients.traditional>>.
The third method is performed from the {susemgr}{webui}
; find this method located in <<ref.webui.systems.bootstrapping>>.

.Deprecation Warning
[IMPORTANT]
====
The [command]``mgr-bootstrap --salt`` option will be deprecated as of SUSE Manager 3.1.
To bootstrap a Salt minion call [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` from the command line as you would for a traditional system.
====


The following section assumes you have created a SUSE Manager tools repository.
You can review creating a tools repository in <<create.tools.repository>>.


[WARNING]
.Ensure the Salt Master is Reachable During Bootstrap
====
The Salt master and its proxy should always be reachable via both IP address and the FQDN.
In the following rare scenario:

* The Salt master (SUSE Manager) is in some DNS.
* Your Minions are in a different subnet bound to an alternate DNS and the Salt master record is absent.
* The Salt master cannot know that the minion is not utilizing the same DNS record. The the Salt master nevertheless sends the FQDN of itself to the minion expecting it to join.
* The minion looks for a different DNS, one where the master record does not exist therefore bootstrap fails.

====


Once you have fully synced a base channel from the {webui}
for clients to obtain software sources from, for example: `SLES12-SP3-Pool_for_x86_64` perform the following procedure to register a Salt minion.

.Procedure: Registering Salt Minions
. On your minion as {rootuser} enter the following command:
+

----
zypper ar http://`FQDN.SUSE.Manager.com`/pub/repositories/sle/12/3/bootstrap/ \
   sles12-sp3
----
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not use ``HTTPS``.
Use `HTTP` instead to avoid errors.
====
+

. After adding the repository containing the necessary Salt packages execute:
+

----
zypper in salt-minion
----
. Modify the minion configuration file to point to the fully qualified domain name ([replaceable]``FQDN``) of the {susemgr} server (master):
+

----
vi /etc/salt/minion
----
+
Find and change the line:
+

----
master: salt
----
+
to:
+

----
master:`FQDN.SUSE.Manager.com`
----
. Restart the Salt minion with:
+

----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----
+

or on non-systemd OS:
+

----
rcsalt-minion restart
----
//TODO Update this is incorrect, onboarding was removed.
Your newly registered minion should now show up within the {webui} under menu:Salt[Onboarding].
Accept the key to begin management.
