[[at.k8s.integration.requires]]
== Prerequisites


The prerequisites listed below should be met before proceeding. 

* At least one _Kubernetes_ or _SUSE CaaS Platform _ cluster available on your network
* {susemgr} configured for container management
+
NOTE: Required channels are present, a registered build host available etc.
+

* [package]#virtual-host-gatherer-Kubernetes# package installed on your {susemgr} server


== Requirements

* Kubernetes version 1.5.0 or higher. Alternatively use SUSE CaaS Platform _(SUSE CaaS Platform includes Kubernetes 1.5.0 by default)_
* Docker version 1.12 or higher on the container build host


[NOTE]
====
To enable all Kubernetes related features within the {webui}
, the [package]#virtual-host-gatherer-Kubernetes#
 package must be installed.
====

== Register Kubernetes as a Virtual Host Manager

_
Kubernetes_ clusters are registered with SUSE Manager as ``virtual host managers``.
Registration and authorization begins with importing a `kubeconfig` file using Kubernetes official command line tool ``kubectl``.

.Procedure: Registering a Kubernetes Cluster with {susemgr}
. Select menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers] from the navigation menu.
. Expand the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner of the page and select menu:Kubernetes Cluster[] .
. Input a label for the new Virtual Host Manager.
. Select the `kubeconfig` file which contains the required data for the Kubernetes cluster.
. Select the correct _context_ for the cluster, as specified in the kubeconfig file.
. Click ``Create``.


== Viewing the List of Nodes in a Cluster


. Select menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers] from the navigation menu.
. Select the desired Kubernetes cluster to view it.
. Node data is not refreshed during registration. To refresh node data, click on ``Schedule refresh data``.
. Refresh the browser. If the node data is not available wait a few moments and try again.


== Obtaining Runtime Data about Images


See the following steps to find runtime data for images.


. Select menu:Images[Images] from the navigation menu.
. In the image list table, take notice of the new runtime columns. These are labeled: ``Revision``, `Runtime` and ``Instances``. Initially these columns will not provide useful data.
** ``Revision``: An artificial sequence number which increments on every rebuild for manager-built images, or on every reimport for externally built images.
** ``Runtime``: Overall status of the running instances of the image throughout the registered clusters. The status can be one of the following:
*** All instances are consistent with SUSE Manager: All the running instances are running the same build of the image as tracked by SUSE Manager.
*** Outdated instances found: Some of the instances are running an older build of the image. A redeploy of the image into the pod may be required.
*** No information: The checksum of the instance image does not match the image data contained in SUSE Manager. A redeploy of the image into the pod may be required.
** ``Instances``: Number of instances running this image across all the clusters registered in SUSE Manager. A breakdown of numbers can be seen by clicking on the pop-up icon next to the number.


== Building an image for deployment in Kubernetes


The following steps will help you build an image for deployment in Kubernetes.


. Under menu:Images[Stores] , create an image store.
. Under menu:Images[Profiles] , create an image profile (with a Dockerfile which is suitable to deploy to Kubernetes).
. Under menu:Images[Build] , build an image with the new profile and wait for the build to finish.
. Deploy the image into one of the registered Kubernetes clusters (via ``kubectl``).
. Notice the updated data in `Runtime` and `Instances` columns in the respective image row. 


== Importing an image already deployed in Kubernetes


The following steps will guide you through importing a previously deployed image in Kubernetes.


. Select an image that has already been deployed to any of your registered Kubernetes clusters.
. Add the registry owning the image to SUSE Manager as an image store.
. Select menu:Images[Images] , click `Import` from the top-right corner, fill in the form fields and click ``Import``.
. Notice the updated data in `Runtime` and `Instances` columns in the respective image row.


== Obtaining Additional Runtime Data


The following steps will help you find additional runtime data.


. Select to menu:Images[Images] , click the `Details` button on the right end of a row which has running instances.
. Under the `Overview` tab, notice the data in `Runtime` and `Instances` fields under `Image Info` section.
. Select the `Runtime` tab.
. Here is a breakdown of the Kubernetes pods running this image in all the registered clusters including the following data:
** Pod name 
** Namespace which the pod resides in 
** The runtime status of the container in the specific pod. Status icons are explained in the preceeding example.


== Rebuilding a Previously Deployed Image in Kubernetes


The following steps will guide you through rebuilding an image which has been deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.


. Go to menu:Images[Images] , click the Details button on the right end of a row which has running instances. The image must be manager-built.
. Click the `Rebuild` button located under the `Build Status` section and wait for the build to finish.
. Notice the change in the `Runtime` icon and title, reflecting the fact that now the instances are running a previous build of the image. 


== Role Based Access Control Permissions and Certificate Data

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, only kubeconfig files containing all embedded certificate data may be used with SUSE Manager
====


The API calls from {susemgr}
are:

* GET /api/v1/pods
* GET /api/v1/nodes


According to this list, the minimum recommended permissions for {susemgr}
should be as follows:

* A ClusterRole to list all the nodes:
+

----
resources: ["nodes"]
verbs: ["list"]
----
* A ClusterRole to list pods in all namespaces (role binding must not restrict the namespace):
+

----
resources: ["pods"]
verbs: ["list"]
----


Due to a a 403 response from /pods, the entire cluster will be ignored by SUSE Manager.
