Open menu:Main Menu[Salt] from the left navigation sidebar.
menu:Main Menu[Salt > Keys] provides an overview of your Salt minions (clients).
Use [guimenu]``Remote Commands`` to execute remote commands on your Salt minions.
You can also define a [guimenu]``State Catalog`` for creating a collection of salt system states.



[[ref.webui.salt.onboarding]]
== Keys

The [guimenu]``Keys`` page provides a summary of your minions, including their names, fingerprints, state, and actions you may perform on them.

Once you have pointed a minion to the {susemgr} server as its master within [replaceable]``/etc/salt/minion``, you can choose to accept or reject a minion from this page.
Toggle the check mark or cross in the `actions` column.

.Remote Commands Security
[WARNING]
====
All commands run from the [guimenu]``Remote Commands`` page are executed as {rootuser} on minions.
Wildcards can be used to run commands across any number of systems, so always take extra precaution as this may have drastic consequences for your systems.
====


On the menu:Salt[Remote Commands] page you will see two text boxes.
The first box is for entering commands.
The second box is for targeting minions by name, group, or by using wildcards.

Input a command you want to execute, add a target minion, group, or wildcard you want to execute the command on.
Select the btn:[Find Targets] button to verify which machines will be targeted.
Select the btn:[Run Command] button to execute a command on selected systems.
