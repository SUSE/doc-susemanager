(((Web UI,Software and Configuration Files)))

(((WebLogic,channels)))


The pages in the menu:Software[]
 category enable you to view and manage software channels and packages associated with your systems. 

[[_ref.webui.channels.software]]
== Channels

(((channel list )))

(((child channel)))

(((WebLogic,channel list)))


The menu:Channels[]
 page is the first to appear in the menu:Software[]
 category.
A software channel provides packages grouped by products or applications to simplify the selection of packages to be installed on a system. 

There are two types of software channels: base channels and child channels. 

[[_s3_sm_channel_list_base]]
Base Channels::
A base channel consists of packages built for a specific architecture and release.
For example, all of the packages in {sls}{nbsp}
12 for the `x86_64` architecture make up a base channel.
The list of packages in {sls}{nbsp}
12 for the `s390x` architecture make up a different base channel. 
+
A system must be subscribed to only one base channel assigned automatically during registration based on the {sle}
release and system architecture.
For paid base channels, an associated subscription must exist. 
+

#toms 2011-02-07: Need to add a section about Long Term Support?#
endif::showremarks[]

[[_s3_sm_channel_list_child]]
Child Channels::
A child channel is associated with a base channel and provides extra packages.
For example, an organization can create a child channel associated with {sls}
on `x86_64` architecture that contains extra packages for a custom application. 
+
Especially important are the {susemgr}
Tools channels that are available for every base channel.
These tools channels provide the tools needed to connect the clients with the {susemgr}
server. 
+
A system can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel.
Only packages provided by a subscribed channel can be installed or updated. {susemgr}
Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority.
This authority gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels. 
+


[NOTE]
====
Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system. 
====
+
Channels can be further distinguished by relevance: menu:All[]
, menu:SUSE[]
, menu:Channels[]
, menu:My Channels[]
, menu:Shared[]
, and menu:Retired[]
.

Finally, only cloned or custom patches may be added to custom channels.
Patches may be included in a cloned channel if they are selected during channel creation.

* it does not contain a package that the original patch has, or it has at least one package with a different version with regard to the corresponding one in the original patch, or both. 


Clicking the menu:Sync Patches[]
 button opens a confirmation page in which a subset of those patches can be selected for synchronization.
Clicking the menu:Confirm[]
 button in the confirmation page results in such patches being copied over from the original channel to the cloned channel, thus updating corresponding packages.
