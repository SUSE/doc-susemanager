The pages in the menu:Software[]
 category enable you to view and manage software channels and packages associated with your systems.

== Channels

(((channel list )))

(((child channel)))

(((WebLogic,channel list)))


The menu:Channels[]
 page is the first to appear in the menu:Software[]
 category.
A software channel provides packages grouped by products or applications to simplify the selection of packages to be installed on a system.

There are two types of software channels: base channels and child channels.

[[s3-sm-channel-list-base]]
Base Channels::
A base channel consists of packages built for a specific architecture and release.
For example, all of the packages in {sls}{nbsp}
12 for the `x86_64` architecture make up a base channel.
The list of packages in {sls}{nbsp}
12 for the `s390x` architecture make up a different base channel.
+
A system must be subscribed to only one base channel assigned automatically during registration based on the {sle}
release and system architecture.
For paid base channels, an associated subscription must exist.
+

#toms 2011-02-07: Need to add a section about Long Term Support?#
endif::showremarks[]

[[s3-sm-channel-list-child]]
Child Channels::
A child channel is associated with a base channel and provides extra packages.
For example, an organization can create a child channel associated with {sls}
on `x86_64` architecture that contains extra packages for a custom application.
+
Especially important are the {susemgr}
Tools channels that are available for every base channel.
These tools channels provide the tools needed to connect the clients with the {susemgr}
server.
+
A system can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel.
Only packages provided by a subscribed channel can be installed or updated. {susemgr}
Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority.
This authority gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels.
+

NOTE: Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system.
+


+
Channels can be further distinguished by relevance: menu:All[]
, menu:SUSE[]
, menu:Channels[]
, menu:My Channels[]
, menu:Shared[]
, and menu:Retired[]
.

* Revert subscriptions from a custom base channel to the appropriate distribution-based base channel.


[NOTE]
====
The assigned base channel must match the installed system.
For example, a system running {sle}{nbsp}
11 for `x86_64` cannot be registered to a {sle}{nbsp}
12 for `s390x` base channel.
Use the files [path]``/etc/os-release``

==== menu:Manage Software Channels[] > menu:Channel Details[] > menu:Patches[]


Channel managers can list, remove, clone, and add patches to their custom channel.
Custom channels not cloned from a distribution may not contain patches until packages are available.
Only patches that match the base architecture and apply to a package in that channel may be added.
Finally, only cloned or custom patches may be added to custom channels.
Patches may be included in a cloned channel if they are selected during channel creation.

The menu:Sync[]
 tab lists patches that were updated since they were originally cloned in the selected cloned channel.
More specifically, a patch is listed here if and only if:

* it is a cloned patch,
* it belongs to the selected cloned channel,
* it has already been published in the selected cloned channel,
* it does not contain a package that the original patch has, or it has at least one package with a different version with regard to the corresponding one in the original patch, or both.


Clicking the menu:Sync Patches[]
 button opens a confirmation page in which a subset of those patches can be selected for synchronization.
Clicking the menu:Confirm[]
 button in the confirmation page results in such patches being copied over from the original channel to the cloned channel, thus updating corresponding packages.

[[s4-cnlmgmt-cdetails-pkgs]]

[command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` creates log files in the [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync``
 directory. {susemgr}
 uses one log file per channel and reuses it with the next synchronization run.

[[ref.webui.channels.mapping]]
== Distribution Channel Mapping


The Distribution Channel Mapping page displays a list of all your defined default base channels that clients will pick up according to their operating system and architecture at registration time.
These mappings can be overriden, but cannot be deleted.

Several columns provide information for each mapping.

.Using Distribution Channel Mapping
[NOTE]
====
For {sle}
