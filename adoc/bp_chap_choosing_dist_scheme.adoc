There are two methods for managing your subscriptions.
Both methods access {scc}
and provide specialized benefits.

* Directly connecting to {scc} is the recommended default way of managing your {productname} server.
* If you have special network security requirements which do not allow access from your internal network to the internet then you can use {sls} 12 running the {rmtool} (RMT) or {smtool} (SMT).  These tools will contact {scc} from a system connected to the external network and obtain updates for your clients which you may then mount on your internal {productname} server. This is the preferred method for managing client systems within a highly secure network infrastructure.


[[scc]]
== {scc} (SCC)

{scc}
(SCC) is the central place to manage your purchased {suse}
subscriptions, helping you access your update channels and get in contact with {suse}
experts.
The user-friendly interface gives you a centralized view of all your {suse}
subscriptions, allowing you to easily find all subscription information you need.
The improved registration provides faster access to your patches and updates. {scc}
is also designed to provide a common platform for your support requests and feedback.
Discover a new way of managing your {suse}
account and subscriptions via one interface--anytime, anywhere.
For more information on using {scc}
, see https://scc.suse.com/docs/userguide.

[[disconnect-setup]]
== Disconnected Setup with RMT or SMT (DMZ)


If it is not possible to connect {productname}
directly or via a proxy to the Internet, a disconnected setup in combination with RMT or SMT is the recommended solution.
In this scenario, RMT or SMT stays in an "`external`"
 network with a connection to {scc}
 and synchronizes the software channels and repositories on a removable storage medium.
Then you separate the storage medium from RMT or SMT, and mount it locally on your {productname}
 server to read the updated data.

.RMT
The successor of SMT and currently runs on the following systems:

* {sle} 15 (when available)
* Temporarily (for testing only): 12 SP2, and 12 SP3
* Not officially supported: openSUSE Leap 42.2, Leap 42.3, and openSUSE Tumbleweed


RMT allows you to provision updates for all of your devices running a product based on {sle}
 12 SPx and later as well as openSUSE Leap.

.SMT
The predecessor of RMT and is no longer actively developed.
It runs on {sls}
 12 SPx and allows you to provision updates for products based on {sle}
 12 SPx and earlier.
You will still need it, if you want to update {sle}
 11 clients.

[[rmtool]]
=== {rmtool} (RMT) and Disconnected Setup (DMZ)


The following procedure will guide you through using RMT.
It will work best with a dedicated RMT instance per {productname}
.

.Procedure: RMT: Fetching Repository Data from {scc}
. Configure RMT in the external network with SCC. For details about configuring RMT, see the official guide (when available).
.. Preparation work:
+
Run [command]``rmt-cli sync`` to download available products and repositories data for your organization from SCC.
+
Run [command]``rmt-cli products list --all`` to see the list of products that are available for your organization.
+
Run [command]``rmt-cli repos list --all`` to see the list of all repositories available.
.. With [command]``rmt-cli repos enable`` enable repositories you want to mirror.
.. With [command]``rmt-cli products enable``enable products. For example, to enable {slsa} _15:
+

----
rmt-cli product enable sles/15/x86_64
----
. Using RMT, mirror all required repositories.
. Get the required JSON responses from SCC and save them as files at the specified path (for example, [path]``/mnt/usb`` ).
+
.Write Permissions for RMT User
IMPORTANT: The directory being written to must be writeable for the same user as the rmt service.
The rmt user setting is defined in the `cli` section of [path]``/etc/rmt.conf``
.
+


+
Enter:
+

----
{prompt.root}rmt-cli export data /mnt/usb
----
. Export settings about repositories to mirror to the specified path (in this case, [path]``/mnt/usb`` ); this command will create a [path]``repos.json`` file there:
+

----
{prompt.root}rmt-cli export settings /mnt/usb
----
+

[[pro.rmtool.export.repos]]
. Mirror the repositories according to the settings in the [path]``repos.json`` file to the specified path (in this case, [path]``/mnt/usb`` ).
+

----
{prompt.root}rmt-cli export repos /mnt/usb
----
. Unmount the storage medium and carry it securely to your {productname} server.


On the {productname}
server, continue with <<disconnect.mgr.update-repos>>.

[[sub.mgr.tool]]
=== {smtool} (SMT) and Disconnected Setup (DMZ)


The following procedure will guide you through using SMT.

.Procedure: SMT: Fetching Repository Data from {scc}
. Configure SMT in the external network with SCC. For details about configuring SMT with {sle} 12, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_smt/data/book_smt.html.
. Using SMT, mirror all required repositories.
. Create a "`database replacement file`" (for example, [path]``/tmp/dbrepl.xml`` ).
+

----
{prompt.root}smt-sync --createdbreplacementfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml
----

[[pro.mgr.tool.mount.storage]]
. Mount a removable storage medium such as an external hard disk or USB flash drive.
. Export the data to the mounted medium:
+

----
smt-sync --todir /media/disk/
smt-mirror --dbreplfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml --directory /media/disk \
           --fromlocalsmt -L /var/log/smt/smt-mirror-export.log
----
+
.Write Permissions for SMT User
IMPORTANT: The directory being written to must be writeable for the same user as the smt daemon (user=smt). The smt user setting is defined in [path]``/etc/smt.conf``
.
You can check if the correct user is specified via the following command:

----
{prompt.root}egrep '^smtUser' /etc/smt.conf
----
+


+
.Keeping the Disconnected Server Up-to-date
NOTE: [command]``smt-sync`` also exports your subscription data.
To keep {productname}
 up-to-date with your subscriptions, you must frequently import and export this data.
+

. Unmount the storage medium and carry it securely to your {productname} server.


On the {productname}
server, continue with <<disconnect.mgr.update-repos>>.

[[disconnect.mgr.update-repos]]
=== Updating Repositories on {productname} From Storage Media


This procedure will show you how to update the repositories on the {productname}
server from the storage media.

.Procedure: Updating the {productname}Server from the Storage Medium
. Mount the storage medium on your {productname} server (for example, at [path]``/media/disk`` ).
. Specify the local path on the {productname} server in ``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:
+

----
server.susemanager.fromdir = /media/disk
----
+
This setting is mandatory for {scc}
and [command]``mgr-sync``.
. Restart Tomcat:
+

----
systemctl restart tomcat
----

[[pro.mgr.tool.sync]]
. Before performing another operation on the server execute a full sync:
+

----
mgr-sync refresh   # SCC (fromdir in rhn.conf required!)
----
. [command]``mgr-sync`` can now be executed normally:
+

----
mgr-sync list channels
mgr-sync add channel channel-label
----
+
.Data Corruption
WARNING: The disk must always be available at the same mount point.
To avoid data corruption, do not trigger a sync, if the storage medium is not mounted.
If you have already added a channel from a local repository path, you will not be able to change its URL to point to a different path afterwards.
+



Up-to-date data is now available on your {productname}
server and is ready for updating client systems.
According to your maintenance windows or update schedule refresh the data on the storage medium with RMT or SMT.

=== Refreshing Data on the Storage Medium

.Procedure: Refreshing Data on the Storage Medium from RMT or SMT
. On your {productname} server, unmount the storage medium and carry it to your RMT or SMT.
. On your RMT or SMT system, continue with the synchronization step (either <<pro.rmtool.export.repos>> or <<pro.mgr.tool.sync>>).
+

[WARNING]
.Data Corruption
====
The storage medium must always be available at the same mount point.
To avoid data corruption, do not trigger a sync if the storage medium is not mounted.
====
+



This concludes using RMT or SMT with {productname}
.
