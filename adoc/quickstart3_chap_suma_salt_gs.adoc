[[salt.gs.guide.intro]]
== Introduction


This section introduces you to the new Salt features added in {productname} 3.
This chapter assumes you have completed all previous Getting Started sections.
At a minimum have the following setup:

* A freshly installed {productname} server with a main admin account and a synced product channel
* Preferably two registered Salt minions to experiment with.

If you find yourself stuck at any point refer to the [ref]_SaltStack Get Started_ tutorial located at https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/fundamentals/index.html.

[NOTE]
====
This guide does not attempt to cover all that Salt has to offer.
This guide is a primer for using Salt with {productname}.
For comprehensive Salt documentation, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/contents.html.
====

The current version of Salt in {productname} is {saltversion}.


[[salt.gs.guide.testing.first.minion]]
== Understanding Salt Calls

Salt Calls::
Salt calls are defined by three main properties:
+

----
salt 'target' <function> [arguments]
----

Target:::
Use the second property in a Salt call to target a single machine or group of machines.
Specify the minion or group of minions you would like to run a function on.

General Targeting::::
List available grains on all minions:
+

----
salt '*' grains.ls
----
+
Ping a specific minion:
+

----
salt 'web1.example.com' test.ping
----
Glob Targeting::::
Ping all minions using a domain:
+

----
salt '*example.com' test.ping
----
+
Display the OS name of all minions with the ``webserver`` label:
+

----
salt 'webserver*' grains.item oscodename
----
List Targeting::::
+

----
salt -L 'webserver.example.com,db.example.com' test.ping
----
Regular Expression Targeting::::
You may use PCRE-compliant regular expressions:
+

----
salt -E '(?!web)' test.ping
----
IP Address Targeting::::
List minion IP addresses:
+

----
salt '*' network.ip_addrs
----
+
Ping a specific minion IP address:
+

----
salt -S '172.31.60.74' test.ping
----
+
Ping all minions on a subnet:
+

----
salt -S 172.31.0.0/16 test.ping
----
+

.Lookup a Subnet Using the [command]``ip`` Command
[TIP]
====
You can use the [command]``ip`` command to find the subnet mask in the format of ``192.168.1.1/24``:

----
ip -o -f inet addr show | awk '/scope global/ {print $4}'
----
====

+

Function::
Once you have specified a target, provide the function you would like to call.
Functions also accept arguments.
Arguments are space-delimited, for example:
+

----
salt '*' cmd.run 'echo "Hello: $FIRST_NAME"' env='{FIRST_NAME: "John"}'
----

Locating Additional Minion Functions:::
Find more functions which can be called on minions by running:
+

----
salt '*' sys.doc
----
+
A full list of callable functions are located here: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/2015.8/ref/modules/all/index.html

Arguments:::
Provides the extra data needed by a function you are calling.
The command [command]``pkg.install`` requires an argument specifying a package to install. {yast} has been selected for installation, for example:
+

----
salt '*' pkg.install yast2
----

[[salt.gs.guide.term.overview]]
== Common Salt Terminology

Grains::
Grains provide information about the hardware of a minion.
For example, the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, memory, etc.
When running a Salt command from keep in mind any modules and functions called are run locally from the system being called.
Salt modules are stored on minions and master within the following directory:
+

----
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/
----
+
List all available grains with the [command]``grains.ls`` function:
+

----
salt '*' grains.ls
----
+
List collected grain system data by using the [command]``grains.ls`` function:
+

----
salt '*' grains.items
----
+
For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/grains/.

States::
States are templates which place systems into a known configuration, for example which applications and services are installed and running on those systems.
States are a way for you to describe what each of your systems should look like.
Once written, states are applied to target systems automating the process of managing and maintaining a large numbers of systems into a known state.
For more information on states, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html.
+

[WARNING]
.Updating Salt
====
Do not update [package]#salt# itself using Salt states.
First update all other system packages using Salt states then update [package]#salt# as a separate stand-alone step from the {productname} {webui}.
====
+

Pillar::
Pillars unlike grains are created on the master.
Pillar files contain information about a minion or group of minions.
Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted minion or group of minions.
Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of minions, variables, and any arbitrary data which should be defined.
For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html.

Beacons::
Beacons allow an admin to use the event system in Salt to monitor non-Salt processes.
Minions may use beacons to hook into many types of system proceses for constant monitoring.
Once a targeted monitored activity occurs an event is sent on the Salt event bus that may be used to trigger a reactor.
+

.Enabling Beacons
IMPORTANT: To work with beacons on Salt minions the package python-pyinotify must be installed for SUSE systems.
For RES systems install python-inotify.
This package is not installed automatically during the salt minion package installation.
+

[NOTE]
.Peer Communication with salt-broker
====
The salt-broker acts like a switch and not like a hub, therefore Peer communication will only work for minions behind the same broker/Proxy.
For more information on Salt and peer communication see: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/peer.html
====
+


[[salt.gs.guide.useful.salt.commands]]
== Useful Salt Commands


The following list provides several useful Salt commands.

salt-run::
Print a list of all minions that are up:
+

----

+

----
salt-run manage.down
----
+
Print a list with the current status of all Salt minions:
+

----
salt-run manage.status
----
+
Check the version of Salt running on the master and active minions:
+

----
salt-run manage.versions
----

salt-cp::

+

----
salt-cp '*' foo.conf /root
----
+
For more information, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/cli/salt-cp.html.

salt-key -l::
List public keys:
+

----
salt-key -l
----

[[salt.gs.guide.salt.file.locations]]
== Salt File Locations and Structure


The following screen describes Salt file structures and their locations used by the {productname} Server.
These files are listed in [path]``/etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf``:

----
# Configure different file roots

file_roots:
  base:
    - /usr/share/susemanager/salt    #Should not be touched by a user
    - /srv/susemanager/salt          #Should not be touched by a user
    - /srv/salt                      #Your custom states go here

# Configure different pillar roots

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /usr/share/susemanager/pillar  #Should not be touched by a user
    - /srv/pillar                    #Custom pillars go here

# Extension modules path

extension_modules: /usr/share/susemanager/modules

# Master top configuration

master_tops:
  mgr_master_tops: True
----

The following tips should be kept in mind when working with [path]``/etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf``.

* Files listed are searched in the order they appear.
* The first file found is called.

[[salt.gs.guide.salt.file.locations.file.roots]]
=== file_roots

{productname} as the Salt master reads its state data from three specific file root directories.

/usr/share/susemanager/salt::
This directory is created by {productname} and its content generated by the [path]``/usr/share/susemanager/modules/tops/mgr_master_tops.py`` python module.
It is shipped and updated together with {productname} and includes certificate setup and common state logic that will be applied to packages and channels.
+

[WARNING]
.Do Not Edit
====
You should not edit or add custom Salt data to this directory.
====
+

/srv/susemanager/salt::
This directory is created by {productname} and contains assigned channels and packages for minions, groups, and organizations.
These files will be overwritten and regenerated.
A good analogy for this directory would be the SUSE Manager database translated into Salt directives.
+

[WARNING]
.Do Not Edit
====
You should not edit or add custom Salt data to this directory.
====
+

/srv/salt::
The directory [path]``/srv/salt`` is for your custom state data, salt modules etc.
SUSE Manager does not perform any actions on this directory.
However the state data placed here affects the Highstate of minions and is merged with the result generated by {productname}.
+

[NOTE]
.Editable
====
Place custom Salt data here.
====

[[salt.gs.guide.salt.file.locations.pillar.roots]]
=== pillar_roots

{productname} as the Salt master reads its pillar data from two specific pillar root directories.

/usr/share/susemanager/pillar::
This directory is generated by {productname}.
It is shipped and updated together with {productname}.
+

[WARNING]
.Do Not Edit
====
You should not edit or add custom Salt data to this directory.
====
+

/srv/pillar::
{productname} by default does not touch or do anything with this directory.
However the custom pillar data placed here is merged with the pillar result created by {productname}.
+

[TIP]
.Editable Directory
====
Place your custom Salt pillar data here.
====


== Install the SUSE Manager Locale Formula


The following section provides guidance on installing and using SUSE provided Salt formulas.

.Procedure: Installing the Locale Formula
. Install the locale formula with:
+

----
zypper install locale-formula
----
+
NOTE: This installs the package contents to [path]``/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/{metadata,states}``
+

. After installing the RPM, log in to the {productname} {webui}.

. Browse to the menu:Main Menu[System Details] page of any minion you would like to apply the formula to.

. On the menu:Main Menu[System Details] page you will see a new btn:[Formulas] tab.
Select it to view a list of installed formulas.

. From the btn:[Formulas] list select menu:Formulas[Locale] and click btn:[Save].

. A new tab will appear next to the menu:Formula[Locale] subtab. Select the new menu:Formulas[Locale] tab.

. The menu:Formalas[Locale] tab contains options for setting the language, keyboard layout, timezone, and whether hardware clock is set to UTC. Select the desired options and click btn:[Save].

. Run the following command to verify pillar settings. The output has been truncated.
+

----
salt '$your_minion' pillar.items
----
+

----
...
   keyboard_and_language:
       ----------
       keyboard_layout:
           English (US)
       language:
           English (US)
   machine_password:
       foobar
   mgr_server:
       manager_server
   org_id:alt '$your_minion_here'
       1
   timezone:
       ----------
       hardware_clock_set_to_utc:
           True
       name:
           CET
    ...
----

. Apply this state to your minion by applying the highstate from the command line with:
+

----
salt '$your_minion' state.highstate
----
+

[NOTE]
====
You can also apply the highstate from the previous formula tab from the {productname} {webui} by selecting menu:System Details[States] and clicking btn:[Apply Highstate].
====
