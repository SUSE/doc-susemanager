== Latest Changes

{revnumber} {revdate}



=== Updated Documentation Structure

We have received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback about our documentation over the years, but we have also received some excellent ideas for improvement.
That is how we know that the content we have is great, but it was sometimes difficult to find.
In this release, we have reorganized our documentation and updated our tooling to make it clearer where information is, and make it easier for you to find the content you need, when you need it.

Please keep the feedback coming!
In this new layout, you can propose changes directly by clicking the btn:[Edit this Page] button.
Otherwise, you can always email us at TBD@suse.de
TODO:: check email address

[[search]]
=== Real Time Search

We have added a prototype of real time search using Algolia.
We are still developing an alternative for offline reading.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use this feature for production!
The search feature is currently a prototype and points to development and testing sources.
====



[[new-ui]]
=== Antora Static Site

All {susemgr} documentation is now written in AsciiDoc and built with Antora.
This makes it significantly easier for readers to become contributors by being able to edit the page directly in plain text (no more XML!).



[[view-branches]]
=== Documentation by Version

Beginning with {productname}{nbsp}4.0, you will be able to select which version of the documentation you want to view, by using the version switcher at the bottom of the navigation pane.



[[contribute]]
=== User Contributions

You may now contribute directly to any document you are currently viewing.

.Procedure: Contributing to documentation
. Select the btn:[Edit this page] link (Top right of the document)
. You will be directed to Github. Login, make your changes then submit a pull request.
. Your request will be reviewed by a technical writer and published.



[[publishing]]
=== Faster Publishing

Our new documentation site implements continuous integration with TravisCI.
As soon as as change is approved, TravisCI rebuilds the documentation and updates the published version within 3-5 minutes.



== Known Issues

=== PDF Output

We do not currently have PDF versions of books available.
This is expected in the beta2 release.


=== Cross references

Cross references between docs are not currently working as expected, as a result of the conversion process.
During the beta, the correct references will be added and these will begin to work correctly.


=== Missing Content

You might notice some placeholder text or blank pages in some sections.
This is either content that we have not yet written, or content that has not yet been moved from its old home.
These will be corrected during the beta.

=== Images

Some images might be missing, or might fail to load.
This is either because we need to take new screenshots, develop new graphics, or content that has not yet been moved from its old home.
These will be corrected during the beta.
