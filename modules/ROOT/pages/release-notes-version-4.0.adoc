=== Known Issues in {docversion}

xref-converter.rb - (Affects PDF Documents)::
Our custom Asciidoctor xref extension converter requires minor refactoring as several links are incorrectly transforming during our PDF conversion. The cross reference styling will seem a little strange in our PDFs until we make the change.

search - (Affects the Product WebUI)::
The Algolia search field has been disabled in the {productname} documentation WebUI. Use the **Help -> Search** page in the WebUI to look for topics. Search will be integrated into the documentation WebUI in an update. Search is available on link:https:/www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-4/[].

=== Known Issues


==== Images

Some images might be missing, or might fail to load.
This is either because we need to take new screenshots, develop new graphics, or content that has not yet been moved from its old home.
These will be corrected in a minor release.


== Beta 2 Changes

=== Updated Documentation Structure

We have received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback about our documentation over the years, but we have also received some excellent ideas for improvement.
That is how we know that the content we have is great, but it was sometimes difficult to find.
In this release, we have reorganized our documentation and updated our tooling to make it clearer where information is, and make it easier for you to find the content you need, when you need it.

Please keep the feedback coming!
In this new layout, you can propose changes directly by clicking the btn:[Edit this Page] button.
You can also report an issue by clicking [guimenu]``Report Issue`` in the [guimenu]``Resources`` menu.

[[cleanup-ia]]

All {productname} books have been reworked into a new structure.



==== Old Naming Format

* Getting Started
* Best Practices
* Reference
* Advanced Topics



==== New Naming Format

* Installation Guide (Requirements, supported platforms, installation methods, etc)

[[search]]
=== Real Time Search

We have added a prototype of real time search using Algolia.
We are still developing an alternative for offline reading.


The search feature of this beta release is a prototype and points to development and testing sources.
[[new-ui]]
=== Antora Static Site

All {susemgr} documentation is now written in AsciiDoc and built with Antora.
This makes it significantly easier for readers to become contributors by being able to edit the page directly in plain text (no more XML!).



[[view-branches]]
=== Documentation by Version

Beginning with {productname}{nbsp}4.0, you will be able to select which version of the documentation you want to view, by using the version switcher at the bottom of the navigation pane.



[[contribute]]
=== User Contributions

You may now contribute directly to any document you are currently viewing.

.Procedure: Contributing to documentation
. Select the btn:[Edit this page] link (Top right of the document)
. You will be directed to Github. Login, make your changes then submit a pull request.
. Your request will be reviewed by a technical writer and published.



[[pdf-output]]
=== PDF Output

Draft PDF documents are now available from the documentation index page.
Asciidoctor-pdf is currently used to produce PDF documents from our antora nav lists.
These documents are draft and should not be used in production.



[[publishing]]
=== Faster Publishing

Our new documentation site implements continuous integration with TravisCI.
As soon as as change is approved, TravisCI rebuilds the documentation and updates the published version within 3-5 minutes.
