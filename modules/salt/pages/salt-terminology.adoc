Grains::
Grains provide information about the hardware of a client.
For example, the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, memory, etc.
When running a Salt command from keep in mind any modules and functions called are run locally from the system being called.
Salt modules are stored on clients and master within the following directory:
+

----
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/
----
+
List all available grains with the [command]``grains.ls`` function:
+

----
salt '*' grains.ls
----
+
List collected grain system data by using the [command]``grains.ls`` function:
+

----
salt '*' grains.items
----
+
For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/grains/.

States::
States are templates which place systems into a known configuration, for example which applications and services are installed and running on those systems.
States are a way for you to describe what each of your systems should look like.
Once written, states are applied to target systems automating the process of managing and maintaining a large numbers of systems into a known state.
For more information on states, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html.

[WARNING]
.Updating Salt
====
Do not update [package]#salt# itself using Salt states.
First update all other system packages using Salt states then update [package]#salt# as a separate stand-alone step from the {productname} {webui}.

Pillar::
Pillars unlike grains are created on the master.
Pillar files contain information about a client or group of clients.
Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients.
Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data which should be defined.
For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html.

Beacons::
Beacons allow an administrator to use the event system in Salt to monitor non-Salt processes.
Clients may use beacons to hook into many types of system proceses for constant monitoring.
Once a targeted monitored activity occurs an event is sent on the Salt event bus that may be used to trigger a reactor.
+

.Enabling Beacons
IMPORTANT: To work with beacons on Salt clients the package python-pyinotify must be installed for SUSE systems.
For RES systems install python-inotify.
This package is not installed automatically during the salt minion package installation.
+

[NOTE]
.Peer Communication with salt-broker
====
The salt-broker acts like a switch and not like a hub, therefore Peer communication will only work for clients behind the same broker or proxy.
For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/peer.html.

[NOTE]
.Salt Environments
====
{productname} implements Salt with a single environment.
Multiple Salt environments are not supported.
