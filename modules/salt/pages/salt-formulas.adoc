= Salt Formulas


This chapter provides an introduction for using Salt Formulas with {productname}.
Creation of custom formulas will also be introduced.



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.what]]
== What are Salt Formulas?

Formulas are collections of Salt States that have been pre-written by other Salt users and contain generic parameter fields.
Formulas allow for reliable reproduction of a specific configuration again and again.
Formulas can be installed from RPM packages or an external git repository.

This list will help you decide whether to use a state or a formula:

.Formula Tips
* When writing states for trivial tasks, formulas are probably not worth the time investment.
* For large, non-trivial configurations use formulas.
* Formulas and States both act as a kind of configuration documentation.
Once written and stored you will have a snapshot of what your infrastructure should look like.
* Pre-written formulas are available from the https://github.com/saltstack-formulas[Saltstack formula repository on Github].
Use these as a starting point for your own custom formulas.
* Formula data can be managed via the XMLRPC API.


[NOTE]
.Formula with Forms Improvements
====
Forms are a graphical representation of the formulas parameter data.
You can customize these configuration data in the {productname} {webui}, with entry fields, drop-down, check boxes, etc.

For more information, see https://www.suse.com/c/forms-formula-success/.

[[best.practice.salt.formulas.install]]
== Installing Salt Formulas via RPM

{suse} releases formulas as RPM packages.
Available formulas can be located within the [systemitem]``SUSE-Manager-Server-3.2-Pool`` channel.


.Salt State Name Clashes
[IMPORTANT]
====
If a Salt Formula uses the same name as an existing Salt State, the two names will collide, and could result in the formula being used instead of the state.
Always check states and formulas to avoid name clashes.
====

.Procedure: Installing Salt Formulas from an RPM
. To search for available formulas, execute the following command on your {productname} server:
+

----
zypper se --type package formula
----
+

You will see a list of available Salt formulas:

[[best.practice.salt.formulas.filedir]]
== File Structure Overview

RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure proper functionality.
A formula always consists of two separate directories: The [path]``states`` directory and the [path]``metadata`` directory.
Folders in these directories need to have an exactly matching name, for example ``locale``.

The Formula State Directory::
The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently.
This includes [path]``.sls`` files, a [path]``map.jinja`` file and any other required files.
This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually.
For example, the [package]#locale-formula# states directory is located in:
+

----
/usr/share/salt-formulas/states/locale/
----
The Formula Metadata Directory::
The metadata directory contains a [path]``form.yml`` file which defines the forms for {productname} and an optional [path]``metadata.yml`` file that can contain additional information about a formula.
For example, the [package]#locale-formula# metadata directory is located in:
+
----
/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/
----

Custom Formulas::
Custom formula data or (non-RPM) formulas need to be placed into any state directory configured as a Salt file root:

State directory:::
Custom state formula data needs to be placed in:
+
----
/srv/salt/<custom-formula-name>/
----

Metadata Directory:::
Custom metadata (information) needs to be placed in:
+

----
/srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/
----

All custom folders located in the following directories need to contain a [path]``form.yml`` file.
These files are detected as form recipes and may be applied to groups and systems from the {webui}:

----
/srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/form.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The Salt formula directory changed in {productname}{nbsp}4.0.
The old directory location, [path]``/usr/share/susemanager/formulas``, will continue to work for some time.
You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, [path]``/usr/share/salt-formulas/`` as soon as possible.
====


[[best.practice.salt.formulas.pillar]]
== Editing Pillar Data in {productname}

{productname} requires a file called [path]``form.yml``, to describe how formula data should look within the {webui}.
[path]``form.yml`` is used by {productname} to generate the desired form, with values editable by a user.

For example, the [path]``form.yml`` that is included with the [package]#locale-formula# is placed in:

----
/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml
----

See part of the following [package]#locale-formula# example:

[path]``form.yml`` contains additional information that describes how the form for a pillar should look for {productname}.
This information is contained in attributes that always start with a `$` sign.

[IMPORTANT]
.Ignored Values
====
All values that start with a `$` sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with.
These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata.
====

The following are valid attributes.

$type::
The most important attribute is the `$type` attribute.
It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated.
The following represent the supported types:

** `text`
** `password`
** `number`
** `url`
** `email`
** `date`
** `time`
** `datetime`
** `boolean`
** `color`
** `select`
** `group`
** `edit-group`
** `namespace`
** `hidden-group` (obsolete, renamed to ``namespace``)


[NOTE]
.Text Attribute
====
The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly.
====


Many of these values are self-explanatory:

** The `text` type generates a simple text field
** The `password` type generates a password field
** The `color` type generates a color picker


The ``group``, ``edit-group``, and `namespace` (formerly ``hidden-group``) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data.
All these types support nesting.
For providing default values with nesting, see <<salt.formulas.ex.edit-group-nesting>>.
The difference between `group` and `namespace` is `group` generates a visible border with a heading, and `namespace` shows nothing visually (and is only used to structure pillar data).
The difference between `group` and `edit-group` is: `edit-group` allows to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way.
`edit-group` is a collection of items of the same kind; collections can have the following four "shapes":

** A list of primitive items
** A list of dictionaries
** A dictionary of primitive items
** A dictionary of dictionaries

The size of each collection is variable; users can add or remove elements.

For example, `edit-group` supports the `$minItems` and `$maxItems` attributes, and thus it simplifies complex and repeatable input structures.
These, and also `itemName`, are optional.
For an `edit-group` example, see <<salt.formulas.ex.edit-group>>.

$default::
`$default` allows you to specify a default value that is displayed and used, if no other value is entered.
In an `edit-group` it allows to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data.

$optional::
`$optional` is a boolean attribute.
If it is `true` and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key.
If `$optional` is `false` and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a `<field name>: null` entry.

$ifEmpty::
The value to be used if the field is empty (because the user did not input
any value).
`ifEmpty` can only be used when `$optional` is `false` or not defined at all!
If `$optional` is `true`, then `$ifEmpty` is ignored.
In the following example, the `DP2` string would be used if user leaves the field empty:
+

----
displayName:
  $type: string
  $ifEmpty: DP2
----

$name::
`$name` allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form.
If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes.
You reference it in the same section with ``pass:c[${name}]``.

$help and $placeholder::
The `$help` and `$placeholder` attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be.
** `$help` defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field
** `$placeholder` displays a gray placeholder text in the field

`$placeholder` may only be used with text fields like text, password, email or date.
It does not make sense to add a placeholder if you also use `$default` as this will hide the placeholder.

$key::
`$key` is applicable if the `edit-group` has the "shape" of a dictionary; you use it when the pillar data is supposed to be a dictionary.
The `$key` attribute then determines the key of an entry in the dictionary.
Example:
+

----
user_passwords:
  $type: edit-group
  $minItems: 1
  $prototype:
    $key:
        $type: text
    $type: text
  $default:
    alice: secret-password
    bob: you-shall-not-pass
----
+

Pillar:
+

----
user_passwords:
  alice:
    secret-password
  bob:
    you-shall-not-pass
----

$minItems and $maxItems::
In an ``edit-group``, `$minItems` and `$maxItems` allow you to specify the lowest and highest number the group can occur.

$itemName::
In an ``edit-group``, `$itemName` allows you to define a template for the name to be used for the members of the group.

$prototype::
In an ``edit-group``, `$prototype` is mandatory and allows to define default (or pre-filled) values for newly added members in the group.

$scope::
`$scope` allows you to specify a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited.
Possible values are ``system``, `group`, and ``readonly``.
+

The default `$scope: system` allows values to be edited at group and system levels.
A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default.
+

If using ``$scope: group``, a value may only be edited for a group.
On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it.
+

The `$scope: readonly` option makes a field read-only.
It can be used to show a user data which should be known, but should not be editable.
This option only makes sense in combination with the ``$default`` attribute.

$visibleIf::
`$visibleIf` allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met.
A condition always looks similar to the following example:
+

----
some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true
----
+

The left part of the above statement is the path to another value, and groups are separated by `$` signs.
The middle section of the command should be either `==` for a value to be equal or `!=` for values that should be not equal.
The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have.
+

The field with this attribute associated with it will now be shown only when the condition is met.
In this example the field will be shown only if `my_checkbox` is checked.
The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes.
It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, etc.
+

A check box should be structured like the following example:
+

----
some_group:
  $type: group

  another_group:
    $type: group

      my_checkbox:
        $type: boolean
----
+

Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot means sibling, 2 dots mean parent, etc. This is mostly useful for ``edit-group``.
+

----
some_group:
  $type: group

  another_group:
    $type: group

    my_checkbox:
      $type: boolean

    my_text:
      $visibleIf: .my_checkbox

  yet_another_group:
    $type: group

    my_text2:
      $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox

----
+

By using multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a user to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value.
+

// [NOTE]
// .Hidden Values
// ====
Values from hidden fields may be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client.
A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data.
For example:
// ====
+
----
show_option:
  $type: checkbox
some_text:
  $visibleIf: show_option == true
----
+
----
{% if pillar.show_option %}
do_something:
  with: {{ pillar.some_text }}
{% endif %}
----

$values::
`$values` can only be used together with ``$type``: select to specify the different options in the select-field.
`$values` must be a list of possible values to select.
For example:
+

----
select_something:
  $type: select
  $values: ["option1", "option2"]
----
+

Or alternatively:
+

----
select_something:
  $type: select
  $values:
    - option1
    - option2
----



[[salt.formulas.ex.edit-group]]
=== Simple edit-group Example

See the following *edit-group* example:

----
partitions:
  $name: "Hard Disk Partitions"
  $type: "edit-group"
  $minItems: 1
  $maxItems: 4
  $itemName: "Partition ${name}"
  $prototype:
    name:
      $default: "New partition"
    mountpoint:
      $default: "/var"
    size:
      $type: "number"
      $name: "Size in GB"
  $default:
    - name: "Boot"
      mountpoint: "/boot"
    - name: "Root"
      mountpoint: "/"
      size: 5000
----

After clicking btn:[Add] for one time you will see <<fig-formula-custom-harddisk-partitions>> filled with the default values.
The formula itself is called [path]``hd-partitions`` and will appear as [guimenu]``Hd Partitions`` in the {webui}.

.`edit-group` Example in the {webui}
[[fig-formula-custom-harddisk-partitions]]
image::formula-custom-harddisk-partitions.png[]

To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group.
When form fields are properly filled confirm with clicking btn:[Save Formula] in the upper right corner of the formula.


[[salt.formulas.ex.edit-group-nesting]]
=== edit-group Example with Nesting

See the following *edit-group* example:

----
users:
  $name: "Users"
  $type: edit-group
  $minItems: 2
  $maxItems: 5
  $prototype:
    name:
      $default: "username"
    password:
      $type: password
    groups:
      $type: edit-group
      $minItems: 1
      $prototype:
        group_name:
          $type: text
  $default:
    - name: "root"
      groups:
        - group_name: "users"
        - group_name: "admins"
    - name: "admin"
      groups:
        - group_name: "users"
----



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.writing]]
== Writing Salt Formulas

Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states, which may be configured with pillar data.
You can parametrize state files using Jinja.
Jinja allows you to access pillar data by using the following syntax.
This syntax works best when you are uncertain whether a pillar value exists as it will throw an error:

----
pillar.some.value
----

When you are sure a pillar exists you may also use the following syntax:

----
salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value')
----

You may also replace the `pillar` value with `grains` (for example, ``grains.some.value``) allowing access to grains.

Using data this way allows you to make a formula configurable.
The following code snippet will install a package specified in the pillar ``package_name``:

----
install_a_package:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: {{ pillar.package_name }}
----

You may also use more complex constructs such as `if/else` and `for-loops` to provide greater functionality:

----
{% if pillar.installSomething %}
something:
  pkg.installed
{% else %}
anotherPackage:
  pkg.installed
{% endif %}
----

Another example:

----
{% for service in pillar.services %}
start_{{ service }}:
  service.running:
    - name: {{ service }}
{% endfor %}
----

Jinja also provides other helpful functions.
For example, you can iterate over a dictionary:

----
{% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %}
do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
----

You may want to have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and you can change these with pillar data.
For example, the following snippet shows how you can manage a file using Salt:

----
/etc/my_program/my_program.conf:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf
    - template: jinja
----


Salt will copy the file [path]``salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf`` on the salt master to [path]``/etc/my_program/my_program.conf`` on the client and template it with Jinja.
This allows you to use Jinja in the file, exactly like shown above for states:

----
some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }}
----



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.data]]
== Separating Data

It is often a good idea to separate data from a state to increase its flexibility and add re-usability value.
This is often done by writing values into a separate file named [path]``map.jinja``.
This file should be placed within the same directory as your state files.

The following example will set `data` to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on.
It will also merge data with the pillar using the `some.pillar.data` value so you can access `some.pillar.data.value` by just using ``data.value``.

You can also choose to override defined values from pillars (for example, by overriding `some.pillar.data.package` in the example).

----
{% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({
    'Suse': {
        'package': 'packageA',
        'service': 'serviceA'
    },
    'RedHat': {
        'package': 'package_a',
        'service': 'service_a'
    }
}, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %}
----

After creating a map file like the above example, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing "deep" pillar data in a simpler way.
Now you can import and use `data` in any file.
For example:

----
{% from "some_folder/map.jinja" import data with context %}

install_package_a:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: {{ data.package }}
----

You can also define multiple variables by copying the `{% set ...%}` statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars.
For example:

----
{% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({
    'Suse': {
        'package': 'my-server-pkg'
    }
}, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %}
{% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({
    'Suse': {
        'package': 'my-client-pkg'
    }
}, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %}
----

To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma.
For Example:

----
{% from "map.jinja" import server, client with context %}
----

Formulas utilized with {productname} should follow formula conventions listed in the official documentation:

* https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.pillardata]]
== {productname} Generated Pillar Data

When pillar data is generated (for example, after applying the highstate) the following external pillar script generates pillar data for packages, group ids, etc. and includes all pillar data for a system:

----
/usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/suma_minion.py
----

The process is executed as follows:

. The `suma_minion.py` script starts and finds all formulas for a system (by checking the `group_formulas.json` and `server_formulas.json` files).
. `suma_minion.py` loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate (default: if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group etc.).
. `suma_minion.py` also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas.
This structure makes it possible to include states.
The top file (in this case specifically generated by the `mgr_master_tops.py` script) includes a state called formulas for each system.
This includes the `formulas.sls` file located in:

[[best.practice.salt.formulas.req]]
== Formula Requirements

Formulas should be designed/created directly after a {productname} installation, but if you encounter any issues check the following:

* The external pillar script (``suma_minion.py``) must include formula data.
* Data is saved to [path]``/srv/susemanager/formula_data`` and the [path]``pillar`` and [path]``group_pillar`` sub-directories.
These should be automatically generated by the server.
* Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file.
Currently this process is initiated by the [path]``mgr_master_tops.py`` script which includes the `formulas.sls` file located in:
+
----
/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/
----
+
Or:
+
----
/usr/share/salt-formulas/states/
----
+

This directory must be a salt file root.
File roots are configured on the salt-master ({productname}) located in:
+

----
/etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf
----



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.using]]
== Using Salt Formulas with {productname}

The following procedure provides an overview on using Salt Formulas with {productname}.


. Official formulas may be installed as RPMs.
Place the custom states within [path]``/srv/salt/your-formula-name/`` and the metadata ([path]``form.yml`` and [path]``metadata.yml``) in [path]``/srv/formula_metadata/your-formula-name/``.
After installing your formulas they will appear in menu:Salt[Formula Catalog].
. To begin using a formula, apply it to a group or system.
Apply a formula to a group or system by selecting the menu:System Details[Formulas] tab of a [guimenu]``System Details`` page or [guimenu]``System Group``. From the menu:System Details[Formulas] page you can select any formulas you wish to apply to a group or system.
Click the btn:[Save] button to save your changes to the database.
. After applying one or more formulas to a group or system, additional tabs will become available from the top menu, one for each formula selected.
From these tabs you may configure your formulas.
. When you have finished customizing your formula values you will need to apply the highstate for them to take effect.
Applying the highstate will execute the state associated with the formula and configure targeted systems.
You can use the btn:[Apply Highstate] button from any formulas page of a group.
. When a change to any of your values is required or you need to re-apply the formula state because of a failure or bug, change values located on your formula pages and re-apply the highstate.
Salt will ensure that only modified values are adjusted and restart or reinstall services only when necessary.


For more information about Salt formulas, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html

For more information about using Salt formulas in a {smr} environment, see xref:retail:retail-formulas-intro.adoc[].




[[bp.saltforms.susemgr.locale]]
=== Locale

The locale formula allows setting [guimenu]``Timezone` and [guimenu]``Keyboard and Language`.



[[bp.saltforms.susemgr.dns]]
=== Domain Name System (Bind)

With the bind formula you set up and configure a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
For technical information about the bind formula and low-level pillar data, see the [path]``README.rst`` file on the {productname} server: [path]``/usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/bind/README.rst``.

DNS is needed to resolve the domain names and host names into IP addresses.
For more information about DNS, see the SLES Administration Guide, Services, The Domain Name System.

.Bind Formula
[[fig-formula-bind-01]]
image::formula-bind-01.png[]

In the [guimenu]``Config`` group you can set arbitrary options such as ``directory`` where are the zone data files (usually [path]``/var/lib/named/``) or  ``forwarders``.
Click btn:[Add Item] to provide more Key/Value fields for configuration.

Check ``Include Forwarders`` if you want to rely on an external DNS server if your DNS is down (or is otherwise not able to resolve an address).



At least, you will configure one zone.  In ``Configured Zones`` define
your zone; for example, `example.com`.  Then in ``Available Zones``
configure this zone: as ``Name`` enter your zone (in this case
`example.com`) and the ``File`` to which this configuration should be
written (`example.com.txt`).  Enter the mandatory ``SOA`` record (start
of authority), and the A, NS, and CNAME ``Records`` you need.

On the other hand, if no `records` entry exists, the zone file is not generated by this state rather than taken from `salt://zones`.  For how to overwrite
this URL, see [path]``pillar.example``.


.bind-02-zones

image::formula-bind-03-records.png[]

.bind-03-records2
[[fig-formula-bind-03-2]]
image::formula-bind-03-records2.png[]

In ``Generate Reverse``, and define reverse mapping and for which zones:

.bind-04-reverse
[[fig-formula-bind-04]]
image::formula-bind-04-reverse.png[]

When saved, data is written to [path]``/srv/susemanager/formula_data/pillar/<salt-client.example.com>_bind.json``.


If you apply the highstate (menu:System Details[States > Highstate]), it first ensures that [package]``bind`` and all required packages will get installed.
Then it will start the DNS service (``named``).



[[bp.saltforms.susemgr.dhcp]]
=== Dhcpd

With the dhcpd formula you set up and configure a DHCP server (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
For technical information about the dhcpd formula and low-level pillar data, see the Pillar example file
[path]``/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/dhcpd/pillar.example``.

DHCP is needed to define network settings centrally (on a server) and let clients retrieve and use this information for local host configuration.
For more information about DHCP, see the SLES Administration Guide, Services, DHCP.

.dhcpd formula
[[fig-formula-dhcpd-01]]
image::formula-dhcpd-01.png[]

Domain Name.

``Domain Name Servers``.  One or more Domain Name Service (DNS) servers.

On which interface(s) the DHCP server should listen (``Listen interfaces``).
Set option for this interface:
Authoritative:
Max Lease Time:
Default Lease Time:

Next is at least one network in the ``Network configuration (subnet)`` group (with IP address, netmask, etc.).  You define every network with ``Dynamic IP range``, ``Routers``, and ``Hosts with static IP addresses (with defaults from subnet)`` (optionally).

And finally ``Hosts with static IP addresses (with global defaults)``.

If you apply the highstate (menu:System Details[States > Highstate]), it first ensures that [package]``dhcp-server`` and all required packages will get installed.
Then it will start the DHCP service (``dhcpd``).



[[bp.saltforms.susemgr.tftp]]
=== Tftpd

With the tftpd formula you set up and configure a TFTP server (Trivial File Transfer Protocol).
A TFTP server is a component that provides infrastructure for booting with PXE.

////
For technical information about the dhcpd formula and low-level pillar data, see the Pillar example file
[path]``/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/dhcpd/pillar.example``.

For more information about setting up TFTP, see the SLES Deployment Guide, Preparing Network Boot Environment, Setting Up a TFTP Server.
// https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/singlehtml/book_sle_deployment/book_sle_deployment.html#sec.deployment.tftp_server


.tftpd formula
[[fig-formula-tftpd-01]]
image::formula-tftpd-01.png[]

For setting up a TFTP server, specify the ``Internal Network Address``, ``TFTP base directory`` (default: [path]``/srv/tftpboot``), and ``run TFTP under user`` (default: [systemitem]``sftp``).

If you apply the highstate (menu:System Details[States > Highstate]), it first ensures that [package]``atftp`` and all required packages will get installed.
Then it will start TFTP (``atftpd``).



[[bp.saltforms.susemgr.vsftp]]
=== Vsftpd

With the vsftpd formula you set up and configure Vsftpd.  Vsftpd is an FTP server or daemon, written with security in mind.  "vs" in its name stands for "Very Secure".



.vsftpd formula
[[fig-formula-vsftpd-01]]
image::formula-vsftpd-01.png[]

For configuring a VSFTP server, specify the settings and options in the Vsftpd formula.
There are settings such as
``FTP server directory``,
``Internal Network Address``
``Enable ssl``, etc.


If you apply the highstate (menu:System Details[States > Highstate]), it first ensures that [package]``vsftpd`` and all required packages will get installed.
Then it will start the VSFTP service (``vsftpd``).


For more information about setting up and tuning Vsftpd, see the documentation coming with the [package]``vsftpd`` package ([path]``/usr/share/doc/packages/vsftpd/`` when the package is installed).
