== Salt Client Onboarding Rate


The rate at which SUSE Manager can on-board clients (accept Salt keys) is limited and depends on hardware resources.
On-boarding clients at a faster rate than SUSE Manager is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys slowing the process and potentially exhausting resources.
It is recommended to limit the acceptance key rate pro-grammatically.
A safe starting point would be to on-board a client every 15 seconds, which can be implemented via the following command:

----
for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done
----

[[bp.chap.salt.minion.scaleability.unaccepted]]
== Clients Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys


Clients which have not been on-boarded, (clients running with unaccepted Salt keys) consume resources, in particular inbound network bandwidth for ~2.5 Kb/s per client.
1000 idle clients will consume around ~2.5 Mb/s, and this number will drop to almost 0 once on-boarding has been completed.
Limit non-onboarded systems for optimal performance.

== Salt Timeouts

=== Background Information


Salt features two timeout parameters called `timeout` and `gather_job_timeout` that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs--it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API.
These two parameters are explained in the following article.

This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable:

* A salt command or job is executed:
+

----
salt '*' test.ping
----
* Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel.
* Clients take that job and start working on it.
* Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients.
* If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses.


If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows:

. If `timeout` is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt [command]``find_job`` job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client.
. Now `gather_job_timeout` is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered.
. If this new [command]``find_job`` job responses that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client's response.
. In case of reaching `gather_job_timeout` without having any response from the client (neither for the initial [command]``test.ping`` nor for the [command]``find_job`` job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients.


By default, {productname} globally sets `timeout` and `gather_job_timeout` to 120 seconds.
So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up _with 240 seconds of waiting_ until getting a response.

[[bp.chap.salt.minion.scaleability.timeouts.presence]]
=== A Presence Ping Mechanism for Unreachable Salt Clients


In order to prevent waiting until timeouts are reached when some clients are down, {suse}
introduced a so-called "presence mechanism" for Salt clients.

This presence mechanism checks for unreachable Salt clients when {productname} is performing synchronous calls to these clients, and it excludes unreachable clients from that call.
Synchronous calls are going to be displaced in favor of asynchronous calls but currently still being used during some workflows.

The presence mechanism triggers a Salt [command]``test.ping`` with a custom and fixed short Salt timeout values.
Default Salt values for the presence ping are: `timeout
     = 4` and ``gather_job_timeout = 1``.
This way, we can quickly detect which targeted clients are unreachable, and then exclude them from the synchronous call.

=== Overriding Salt Presence Timeout Values

{productname} administrators can increase or decrease default presence ping timeout values by removing the comment markers (``\#``) and setting the desired values for `salt_presence_ping_timeout` and `salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout` options in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
# SUSE Manager presence timeouts for Salt clients
# salt_presence_ping_timeout = 4
# salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout = 1
----

////

=== Salt SSH Clients (SSH Push)


Salt SSH clients are slightly different that regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call.
Salt `timeout` and `gather_job_timeout` are not playing a role here.

{productname} defines a timeout for SSH connections in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
# salt_ssh_connect_timeout = 180
----


The presence ping mechanism is also working with SSH clients.
In this case, {productname} will use `salt_presence_ping_timeout` to override the default timeout value for SSH connections.
