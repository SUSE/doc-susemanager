= CVE Audit





The menu:Main Menu[Audit > CVE Audit] page will display a list of client systems with their patch status regarding a given CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) number.

[[s1-cve-usage]]
== Normal Usage

Proceed as follows if you want to verify that a client system has received a given CVE patch:

. Make sure that the CVE data is up-to-date. For more information, see <<sec-cve-maint>>.
. Click menu:Main Menu[Audit > CVE Audit] to open the [guimenu]``CVE Audit`` page.
. Input a 13-char CVE identifier in the [guimenu]``CVE Number`` field. The year setting will be automatically adjusted. Alternatively, set the year manually and add the last four digits.
. Optionally, uncheck the patch statuses you are not interested in.
. Click [guimenu]``Audit systems``.

Performing this procedure will result in a list of client systems, where each system comes with a [guimenu]``Patch Status`` belonging to the given CVE identifier.
Possible statuses are:

image:patch-status-affected-patch-inapplicable.png[scaledwidth=1em] Red - Affected, patches are available in channels that are not assigned:::
The system is affected by the vulnerability and {productname} has one or more patches for it, but at this moment, the channels offering the patches are not assigned to the system.

image:patch-status-affected-patch-applicable.png[scaledwidth=1em] Orange - Affected, at least one patch available in an assigned channel:::
The system is affected by the vulnerability, {productname} has at least one patch for it in a channel that is directly assigned to the system.

image:patch-status-not-affected.png[scaledwidth=1em] Grey - Not affected:::
The system does not have any packages installed that are patchable.

image:patch-status-patched.png[scaledwidth=1em] Green - Patched:::
A patch has already been installed.

In other words, it can mean the following:

* More than one patch might be needed to fix a certain vulnerability.
* The image:patch-status-affected-patch-applicable.png[scaledwidth=1em] Orange - state is displayed when {productname} has at least one patch in an assigned channel.
This might mean that, after installing such a patch, others might be needed—users should double check the CVE Audit page after applying a patch to be sure that their systems are not affected anymore.

For a more precise definitions of these states, see <<sec-cve-tips>>.

[NOTE]
.Unknown CVE Number
====
If the CVE number is not known to {productname}, an error message is displayed because {productname} cannot collect and display any audit data.
====

For each system, the [guimenu]``Next Action`` column contains suggestions on the steps to take to address the vulnerabilities.
Under these circumstances it is either sensible to install a certain patch or assign a new channel.
If applicable, a list of "`candidate`" channels or patches is displayed for your convenience.

You can also assign systems to a [guimenu]``System Set`` for further batch processing.



[[ref-api-usage]]
== API Usage

An API method called `audit.listSystemsByPatchStatus` is available to run CVE audits from custom scripts.
Details on how to use it are available in the API guide.



[[sec-cve-maint]]
== Maintaining CVE Data

To produce correct results, CVE Audit must periodically refresh the data needed for the search in the background.
By default, the refresh is scheduled at 11:00 PM every night.
It is recommended to run such a refresh right after the {productname} installation to get proper results immediately instead of waiting until the next day.

. In the Web interface, click menu:Main Menu[Admin > Task Schedules].
. Click the `cve-server-channels-default` schedule link.
. Click the `cve-server-channels-bunch` link.
. Click the btn:[Single Run Schedule] button.
. After some minutes, refresh the page and check that the scheduled run status is ``FINISHED``.

A direct link is also available on the menu:Main Main[Audit > CVE Audit] page ([guimenu]``extra CVE data update``).



[[sec-cve-tips]]
== Tips and Background Information

Audit results are only correct if the assignment of channels to systems did not change since the last scheduled refresh (normally at 11:00 PM every night).
If a CVE audit is needed and channels were assigned or unassigned to any system during the day, a manual run is recommended.
For more information, see <<sec-cve-maint>>.

Systems are called "`affected`", "`not affected`" or "`patched`" not in an absolute sense, but based on information available to {productname}.
This implies that concepts such as "`being affected by a vulnerability`" have particular meanings in this context.
The following definitions apply:

System affected by a certain vulnerability:::
A system which has an installed package with version lower than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability.

System not affected by a certain vulnerability:::
A system which has no installed package that is also in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability.

System patched for a certain vulnerability:::
A system which has an installed package with version equal to or greater than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability.

Relevant patch:::
A patch known by {productname} in a relevant channel.

Relevant channel:::
A channel managed by {productname}, which is either assigned to the system, the original of a cloned channel which is assigned to the system, a channel linked to a product which is installed on the system or a past or future service pack channel for the system.

A notable consequence of the above definitions is that results can be incorrect in cases of unmanaged channels, unmanaged packages, or non-compliant systems.
