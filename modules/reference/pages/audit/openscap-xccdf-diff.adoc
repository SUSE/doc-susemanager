= XCCDF Diff





XCCDF Diff is an application that visualizes the comparison of two XCCDF scans.
It shows metadata for two scans as well as the lists of results.

Click the appropriate icon on the Scans page to access the diff output of similar scans.
Alternatively, specify the ID of scans you want to compare.

Items that show up in only one of the compared scans are considered to be "varying". Varying items are always highlighted in beige.
There are three possible comparison modes:

Full Comparison::
all the scanned items.

Only Changed Items:::
items that have changed.

Only Invariant:::
unchanged or similar items.
