SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a framework to maintain the security of enterprise systems.
It mainly performs the following tasks:

* Automatically verifying the availability of patches
* Checking system security configuration settings
* Examining systems for signs of compromise

For a description of the {webui} dialogs, see <<s2-openscap-suma-pages>>.

For instructions and tips on how to best use OpenSCAP with {productname}, refer to <<ch-openscap>>.
To learn more about OpenSCAP, see the project home page at http://open-scap.org.

For each scan, the following information is displayed:

System:::
the scanned system.

XCCDF Profile:::
the evaluated profile.

Completed:::
time of completion.

Satisfied:::
number of rules satisfied.
A rule is considered to be satisfied if the result of the evaluation is either Pass or Fixed.

Dissatisfied:::
number of rules that were not satisfied.
A rule is considered Dissatisfied if the result of the evaluation is a Fail.

Unknown:::
number of rules which failed to evaluate.
A rule is considered to be Unknown if the result of the evaluation is an Error, Unknown or Not Checked.


The evaluation of XCCDF rules may also return status results like ``Informational``, ``Not Applicable``, or not ``Selected``.
In such cases, the given rule is not included in the statistics on this page.
See menu:System Details[Audit]
 for information on these types of results.
