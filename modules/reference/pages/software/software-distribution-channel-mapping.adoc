= Distribution Channel Mapping





The [guimenu]``Distribution Channel Mapping`` page displays a list of all your defined default base channels that clients will pick up according to their operating system and architecture at registration time.
These mappings can be overriden, but cannot be deleted.
To create such a mapping click [guimenu]``Create Distribution Channel Mapping`` in the upper-right corner.
Several columns provide information for each mapping.

====
For {sle} or {rhel} {suse} does not use the [guimenu]``Distribution Channel Mapping`` feature.

It can help when letting clients pick up base channels automatically.
