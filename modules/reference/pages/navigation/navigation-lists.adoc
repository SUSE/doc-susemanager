= Lists





The information within most categories is presented in the form of lists.
These lists have some common features for navigation.
For instance, you can set the number of [guimenu]``items per page`` and navigate through virtually all lists by clicking the back and next arrows above and below the right side of the table.
Some lists also offer the option to retrieve items alphabetically by clicking numbers or letters from the [guimenu]``Alphabetical Index`` above the table.

.Performing Large List Operations
[NOTE]
====
Performing operations on large lists (such as removing RPM packages from the database with the {productname} {webui}) may take some time and the system may become unresponsive or signal "`Internal Server Error 500`".
Nevertheless, the command will succeed in the background if you wait long enough.
