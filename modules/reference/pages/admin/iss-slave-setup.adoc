[[s3-sattools-iss-map-orgs]]
== Mapping {productname} Master Server Organizations to Slave Organizations

A mapping between organizational names on the master {productname} allows for channel access permissions being set on the master server and propagated when content is synchronized to a slave {productname}.
Not all organization and channel details need to be mapped for all slaves.
{productname} administrators can select which permissions and organizations can be synchronized by allowing or omitting mappings.

To complete the mapping, log in to the Slave {productname} as administrator.
Click menu:Admin[ISS Configuration > Slave Setup] and select a master {productname} by clicking its name.
Use the drop-down box to map the exported master organization name to a matching local organization in the slave {productname}, then click btn:[Update Mapping].

On the command line, issue the synchronization command on each of the custom channels to obtain the correct trust structure and channel permissions:

----
mgr-inter-sync -c`YOUR-CHANNEL`
----
