2018-12-10, ke: /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date still exists. @renner confirmed some tools use it
                (at least, trad. client).  To be renamed in the future.

Enable Staging Contents::
The clients will download packages in advance and stage them.
This has the advantage that the package installation action will take place immediately, when the schedule is actually executed.
This "`pre-fetching`" saves maintenance window time, which is good for service uptime.

For staging contents ("`pre-fetching`"), edit on the client [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date``:

----
stagingContent=1
stagingContentWindow=24
----

`stagingContentWindow` is a time value expressed in hours and determines when downloading will start.
It is the number of hours before the scheduled installation or update time.
In this case, it means `24` hours before the installation time.
The start time for download depends on the selected contact method for a system.
The assigned contact method sets the time for when the next [command]``mgr_check`` will be executed.

Next time an action is scheduled, packages will automatically be downloaded but not installed yet.
When the scheduled time comes, the action will use the staged version.

Minion Content Staging::
Every Organization administrator can enable Content Staging from the Organization configuration page menu:Admin[Organization > OrgName > Configuration > Enable Staging Contents].

Staging content for clients is affected by two parameters.

* [path]``salt_content_staging_advance:`` expresses the advance time, in hours, for the content staging window to open with regard to the scheduled installation/upgrade time.
* [path]``salt_content_staging_window:`` expresses the duration, in hours, of the time window for Salt clients to stage packages in advance of scheduled installations or upgrades.

A value of *salt_content_staging_advance* equal to *salt_content_staging_window* results in the content staging window closing exactly when the installation/upgrade is scheduled to be executed.
A larger value allows separating download time from the installation time.

These options are configured in [path]``/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java.conf``
 and by default assume the following values:

* [path]``salt_content_staging_advance: 8 hours``
* [path]``salt_content_staging_window: 8 hours``

[NOTE]
====
These parameters will only have an effect when Content Staging is enabled for the targeted Organization.

[[s2-sattools-org-details-states]]
== Organization Details > States

From the menu:Admin[Organizations > States] page you can assign State to all systems in an organization.
For example, this way it is possible to define a few global security policies or add a common admin user to all machines.
