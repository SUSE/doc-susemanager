{suse} distinguishes three types of patches: security updates, bug fix updates, and enhancement updates.
Each patch consists of a summary of the problem and solution, including the RPM packages fixing the problem.

Icons are used to identify the three types:

* image:fa-shield.svg[Security Alert,scaledwidth=1.2em] -- Security Updates available, _strongly_ recommended
* image:fa-bug.svg[Bug Fix Alert,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- Bug Fix Updates available, recommended
* image:spacewalk-icon-enhancement.svg[Enhancement Alert,scaledwidth=1.4em] -- Enhancement Updates available, optional


A summary of each patch is provided in list form displaying its type, advisory ID, synopsis (with the severity as a textual prefix in case of security updates, such as "`critical`", "`important`", "`moderate`", or "`low`"), number of affected systems in your network, and date updated.

In addition, you may view patches by product line at the following location: http://download.suse.com/patch/psdb/.
