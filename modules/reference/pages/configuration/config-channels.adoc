= Configuration Channels

{productname} manages both central and local configuration channels and files.
Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems, and is available for both traditional and salt clients.
For traditional clients, use local configuration management.
For salt clients, use state  channels.
For traditional clients, local configuration management is also available.
Local configuration management allows you to specify overrides, and select configuration files that are not changed when the system is subscribed to a central channel.

A state channel is a type of a configuration channel used only for Salt clients.
In state channels, the [path]``init.sls`` file is not automatically generated, you must manually create and edit it.
State channels can contain arbitrary configuration files that you can reference from within the [path]``init.sls`` file.

.Referencing Configuration Files with Organization ID
[NOTE]
====
You must reference configuration files with the `salt://` prefix, the organization ID, and the channel name.
For example, to reference [path]``/etc/motd`` use:

----
file.managed:  - source: salt://manager_org_1/`channel_name`/etc/motd
----
====


Central configuration or state channels must be created via the links on this page.

Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel.
If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the [guimenu]``List/Remove Files`` page of that channel.
If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the menu:Configuration Channel Details[Systems > Subscribed   Systems] page for that channel.

== Configuration Channel Details

Overview::
The [guimenu]``Overview`` page of the [guimenu]``Configuration Channel Details``
page is divided into several panels.

Channel Information:::
Provides status information for the contents of the channel.

Configuration Actions:::
Provides access to the most common configuration tasks.
For Salt clients, there is a link to edit the [path]``init.sls`` file.

Channel Properties [Management]:::
Edit the name, label, and description of the channel by clicking the btn:[Edit Properties] button.

List/Remove Files::
This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel.
You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels.
Check the box next to files you want to manipulate and click the respective action button.

Add Files::
The [guimenu]``Add Files`` page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to [guimenu]``Upload``, [guimenu]``Import``, or [guimenu]``Create`` configuration files to be included in the channel.

Upload File:::
To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the btn:[Upload Configuration File] button.
The [guimenu]``Filename/Path`` field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed.
+
You can set the [guimenu]``Ownership`` via the [guimenu]``user name`` and [guimenu]``group name`` and the [guimenu]``Permissions`` of the file when it is deployed.
+
If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure [guimenu]``SELinux contexts`` to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type).
+
If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro.
For more information on using macros, see: xref:reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros[Including Macros in your Configuration Files]
+
Import Files:::
To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally-managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import.
Then click the btn:[Import Configuration File(s)] button.
+

NOTE: A sandbox icon (image:spacewalk-icon-sandbox.svg[Spacewalk Icon Sandbox,scaledwidth=0.9em]) indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox.
Files in a system's sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable.
Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel.
+


Create File:::
Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link to be included in the configuration channel.

.Procedure: Creating a Configuration File, Directory, or Symbolic Link
... Choose whether you want to create a text file, directory, or symbolic link in the [guimenu]``File Type`` section.
... In the [path]``Filename/Path`` text box, set the absolute path to where the file should be deployed.
... If you are creating a symbolic link, indicate the target file and path in the [guimenu]``Symbolic Link Target Filename/Path`` text box.
... Enter the [guimenu]``User name`` and [guimenu]``Group name`` for the file in the [guimenu]``Ownership`` section, and the [guimenu]``File Permissions Mode``.
... If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure [guimenu]``SELinux contexts`` to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type).
... If the configuration file includes a macro, enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro.
... Then enter the configuration file content in the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field, using the script drop-down box to choose the appropriate scripting language.
... Click the btn:[Create Configuration File] button to create the new file.

Deploy Files::
This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel.
Deploy all files by clicking the btn:[Deploy All Files] button or check selected files and click the btn:[Deploy Selected Files] button.
Select to which systems the file(s) should be applied.
All systems subscribed to this channel are listed.
If you want to apply the file to a different system, subscribe it to the channel first.
To deploy the files, click btn:[Confirm & Deploy to Selected Systems].

Systems::
Manage systems subscribed to the configuration channel via two subtabs:

Subscribed Systems:::
All systems subscribed to the current channel are displayed.
Click the name of a system to see the [guimenu]``System Details`` page.

Target Systems:::
This subtab displays a list of systems enabled for configuration management but not yet subscribed to the channel.
To add a system to the configuration channel, check the box to the left of the system's name and click the btn:[Subscribe System] button.
