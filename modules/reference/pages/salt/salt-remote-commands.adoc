= Remote Commands

The remote commands page allows you to execute and run commands from the {productname} server on several clients.

// Mounting /tmp with noexec ===
Salt runs remote commands from [filename]``/tmp`` of the client's filesystem.
Therefore you must not mount [filename]``/tmp`` with the [option]``noexec`` option.

.Remote Commands Security
[WARNING]
====
All commands run from the [guimenu]``Remote Commands`` page are executed as {rootuser} on clients.
Wildcards can be used to run commands across any number of systems, so always take extra precaution as this may have drastic consequences for your systems.
====

On the menu:Salt[Remote Commands] page you will see two text boxes.
The first box is for entering commands.
The second box is for targeting clients by the [literal]``minion_id`` value (name), or by a partial match using wildcards.

Input a command you want to execute, then add a target client or a set of clients (using wildcard matching) where you want to execute the command on.
Select the btn:[Find Targets] button to verify which clients will be targeted.
Select the btn:[Run Command] button to execute a command on the selected systems.
