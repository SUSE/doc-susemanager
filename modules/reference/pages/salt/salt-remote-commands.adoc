// Mounting /tmp with noexec ===
Salt runs remote commands from [filename]``/tmp`` of the client's filesystem.
Therefore you must not mount [filename]``/tmp`` with the [option]``noexec`` option.

.Remote Commands Security
[WARNING]
====
All commands run from the [guimenu]``Remote Commands`` page are executed as {rootuser} on clients.
Wildcards can be used to run commands across any number of systems, so always take extra precaution as this may have drastic consequences for your systems.
====

On the menu:Salt[Remote Commands] page you will see two text boxes.
The first box is for entering commands.
The second box is for targeting clients by the [literal]``minion_id`` value (name), or by a partial match using wildcards.

Enter the command you want to execute.
Add a target client to execute the command on, or use wildcard matching to target a group of clients.
Click btn:[Find Targets] to verify which clients will be targeted.
Click btn:[Run Command] to execute the command on the target systems.
