= Keys

The [guimenu]``Keys`` page provides a summary of your clients, including their names, fingerprints, state, and actions you may perform on them.

Once you have pointed a client to the {productname} server as its master within [replaceable]``/etc/salt/minion``, you can choose to accept or reject a client from this page.
Toggle the check mark or cross in the `actions` column.
