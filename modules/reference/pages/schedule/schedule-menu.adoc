= Schedule Menu





menu:Main Menu[Schedule] helps with managing actions and combining actions into action chains.

menu:Main Menu[Schedule] features pages that enable you to manage the actions carried out on your systems.
An action is a scheduled task to be performed on one or more client systems.
For example, an action can be scheduled to apply all patches to a system.
Actions can also be grouped into action chains to schedule them at the same time in a particular order, for example to reboot a system after deploying patches.

{productname} keeps track of the following action types:

* package alteration (installation, upgrade, and removal),
* rollback package actions,
* system reboots,
* patch application,
* configuration file alteration (deploy, upload, and diff),
* hardware profile updates,
* package list profile updates,
* automated installation initiation,
* service pack migrations,
* remote commands.

Each page in the menu:Main Menu[Schedule] category represents an action status.
