Migrating a traditionally registered Proxy system to a Salt Proxy system is not possible.
Re-install the Proxy if you want to switch to Salt.

The following procedure describe software channel setup and registering the installed {productname} Proxy with an activation key as a {productname} client.

. From the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` listing select the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy child channel with the matching update channel ([systemitem]``SUSE Manager Proxy-3.2-Pool`` and [systemitem]``SUSE-Manager-Proxy-3.2-Updates``).
These child channels are required for providing the proxy packages and updates.
For normal SLES clients, [systemitem]``SLES12-SP4-Updates`` plus [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool`` and [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates`` are mandatory.

Using Salt is supported since version 3.2.
