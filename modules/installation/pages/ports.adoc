== {productname} Server

Some ports are only relevant if you actually run the related service on the {productname} server.

.Ports to Open on {productname}Server
67::
Inbound / TCP/UDP / DHCP
+

Required when {productname} is configured as a DHCP server for systems requesting IP addresses.

69::
Inbound / TCP/UDP / TFTP
+
Used when {productname} is configured as a PXE server and allows installation and re-installation of PXE-boot enabled systems.

80::
Inbound / TCP / HTTP
+

Client and proxy server requests travel via HTTP or HTTPS.

80::
Outbound / TCP / HTTP
+

Used to contact {scc}/{ncc}.

443::
Inbound / TCP / HTTPS
+

All {webui}, client, and proxy server requests travel via HTTP or HTTPS.

443::
Outbound / TCP / HTTPS
+

{productname} uses this port to reach {scc} (unless running in a disconnected mode with RMT or SMT{mdash}as described in <<disconnect-setup>>).

5222::
Inbound / TCP / osad
+

When you wish to push actions to clients this port is required by the [systemitem]``osad`` daemon running on your client systems.

5269::
Inbound/Outbound / TCP / jabberd
+

Needed if you push actions to or via a {susemgrproxy}.

4505::
Inbound / TCP / salt
+

Required by the Salt-master to accept communication requests via TCP from clients.
The connection is initiated by the client and remains open to allow the master to send commands.
This port uses a publish/subscribe topology; the client subscribes to notifications from the master.

4506::
Inbound / TCP / salt
+

Required by the Salt-master to accept communication requests via TCP from clients.
The connection is initiated by the client and is open only when needed.
Usually, clients will open this port when they have to report results to the master, such as when a command received on port 4505 has finished.
This port uses a request/response topology; the client sends requests to the master.

25151::
TCP
+

For cobbler.

8050::
Inbound / TCP / websockify

Needed to access graphical console of virtual machines from {productname} web interface.

.Internally Used Ports on {productname} Server
2828::
Internal /
+

Satellite-search API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.

2829::
Internal /
+

Taskomatic API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat.

6868::
Internal
+

Auditlog-keeper to database.

6888::
Internal
+

Auditlog-keeper API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat.

8005::

8080::
Internal
+

9080::
Internal
+

Salt-API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.

32000::
Internal / TCP
+

Port for a TCP connection to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that runs Taskomatic and the search (satellite-search).

[NOTE]
.Ephemeral Ports
====
Anything from port 32768 on (more exactly, what you can see with [command]``cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range``) is an ephemeral port, typically used as the receiving end of a TCP connection.
So if process A opens a TCP connection to process B (for example, port 22), then A chooses an arbitrary source TCP port to match with destination port 22.

Port 80 (http) is not used to serve the {webui}, and is closed in most installations.
Port 80 is used temporarily for some bootstrap repositories and automated installations.
