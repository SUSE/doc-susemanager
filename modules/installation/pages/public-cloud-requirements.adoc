= Public Cloud Requirements






This section details the public cloud specific requirements for {productname}.

[NOTE]
====
Public clouds provide {productname} under a Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) model.
This means that you must register instances with the {scc}.
For more information about registering {productname} with {scc}, see xref:installation:general-requirements.adoc[].
====

Depending on the public cloud framework you are using, you can locate the {productname} images by searching for the  keywords [package]``suse``, [package]``manager``, [package]``proxy``, or [package]``BYOS``.


== Instance Requirements

Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware requirements in xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

In addition, be aware of these considerations:

* The {productname} setup procedure performs a forward-confirmed reverse DNS lookup.
This must succeed in order for the setup procedure to complete successfully and for {productname} to operate as expected.
Therefore, it is important to perform hostname and IP configuration prior to running the {productname} setup procedure.
* {productname} Server and Proxy instances are expected to run in a network configuration that provides you control over DNS entries, but cannot be accessed from the internet at large.
* Within this network configuration DNS resolution must be provided: `hostname -f` must return the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).
* DNS resolution is also important for connecting clients.
* DNS is dependent on the cloud framework you choose, refer to the cloud service provider documentation for detailed instructions.
* We recommend that you locate software repositories, the server database, and the proxy squid cache on an external virtual disk. This prevents data loss if the instance is unexpectedly terminated. Instructions for setting up an external virtual disk are contained in this section.

== Network Requirements

On a public cloud service, you must run {productname} within a restricted network, such as VPC private subnet with an appropriate firewall setting.
The instance must only be able to be accessed by machines in your specified IP ranges.

[WARNING]
====
A world-accessible {productname} instance violates the terms of the {productname} EULA, and is not supported by {suse}.
====

To access the {productname} {webui}, allow HTTPS when configuring the network access controls.

== Using Separate Storage Volume


We recommend that the repositories and the database for {productname} be stored on a virtual storage device.
This best practice will avoid data loss in cases where the {productname} instance may need to be terminated.
These steps *must* be performed *prior* to running the YaST {productname}  setup procedure.


. Provision a disk device in the public cloud environment, refer to the cloud service provider documentation for detailed instructions. The size of the disk is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with {productname}.
For sizing information refer to https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7015050[SUSE Manager sizing examples]. A rule of thumb is 25 GB per distribution per channel.
. Once attached the virtual disk will appear as Unix device node in your instance. The name of the device node is dependend on the cloud framework used, and possibly the instance type selected. Find all the available storage device names with the follwing command:
+

----
$ hwinfo --disk | grep -E "Device File:"
----
. If you are uncertain about the device to choose you can use the `lsblk` command to correlate the size of the devices with their names. Choose the name that matches with the size of the virtual disk you created and attached to the instance.
. With the device name determined you can use the provided `suma-storage` script to set up the external disk as the data base and repository storage location.
+

----
$ /usr/bin/suma-storage DEVICENAME
----

`DEVICENAME` needs to be replaces by the previously determined name for the attached virtual disk.

After the call all database and repository files used by SUSE Manager Server are moved to the newly created xfs based storage.
In case your instance is a {productname} Proxy, the script will move the Squid cache, which caches the software packages, to the newly created storage.
The xfs partition is mounted below the path [path]``/manager_storage``.
