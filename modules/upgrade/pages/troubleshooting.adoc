== {webui} Fails to Load

Sometimes, the {webui} will not load after migration.
This is usually caused by browser caching, if the new system has the same hostname and IP address as the old system.
This duplication can confuse some browsers.

This issue is resolved by clearing the cache and reloading the page.
In most browsers, you can do this quickly by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+F5].



== Not Enough Disk Space

Check the available disk space before you begin migration.
We recommend locating [path]``/var/spacewalk`` and [path]``/var/lib/pgsql`` on separate XFS file systems.

When you are setting up a separate file system, edit [path]``/etc/fstab`` and remove the [path]``/var/lib/pqsql`` subvolume.
Reboot the server to pick up the changes.



== Corrupted Database Dump

If you think your database dump has been corrupted, you can check by using this command with the hostname of the source system:

----
ssh root@source_hostname "su -s /bin/bash - postgres -c exit"
----

The command will only produce output if the database has become corrupted.

If the database is corrupted, check the [path]``.bashrc`` environment file on the source system.
Ensure there is no extra text in the file at the point that the script starts the shell.



== Retrying to Set up the Target System

If you need to retry setting up the target system, follow these steps:

. Delete [path]``/root/.MANAGER_SETUP_COMPLETE``.
. Stop PostgreSQL and remove [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data``.
. Set the target system hostname to match the source system hostname.
. Check the [path]``/etc/hosts`` file, and correct it if necessary.
. Check [path]``/etc/setup_env.sh`` on the target system, and ensure the database name is set:
+
----
MANAGER_DB_NAME='susemanager'
----
. Reboot the target system.
. Run [command]``mgr-setup`` again.
