= Update {productname} Proxy

{productname} Proxies are managed in the same way as clients.
Maintenance updates (MU) can be installed on a {productname} Proxy in the same way as other clients.
Some updates will require a restart of the proxy service.

// a remote command (or a salt state) can perform the restart.
// Creating an Action Chain can help with this task.
// With an action chain you can update proxies on batches, or all at the same time:
// These are the basic steps to run:
////
1. Run a salt command: `spacewalk-proxy stop`
2. Update the packages
3. Run a salt command: `spacewalk-proxy start`
////



== Prepare to Update

Before you perform any proxy update, schedule a maintenance window.
The clients registered to {productname} through the proxy will not be able to connect to {productname} while the upgrade is in progress.
For more information about maintenance windows, see xref:administration/maintenance-window.adoc[].




== Update the Proxy

To update a proxy you first stop the proxy service, then update the software and finally restart the proxy service.

.Procedure: Updating the {productname} Proxy

. On the {productname} Server where the proxy is registered as a client, stop the proxy service:
+
----
spacewalk-proxy stop
----

. Select the packages to be updated on the proxy.

. On the {productname} Server where the proxy is registered as a client, start the proxy service:
+
----
spacewalk-proxy start
----

If you need to update many proxies, you can create an action chain of this command sequence.
You can use the action chain to perform updates on multiple proxies at the same time.
