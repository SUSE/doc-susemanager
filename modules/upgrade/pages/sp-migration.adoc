= Service Pack Migration



SUSE Manager uses {sls} 12 as its underlying operating system.
Therefore Service Pack migration (for example, from version 12 SP1 to 12 SP3) may be performed in the same way as a typical {slsa} migration.

.Upgrading PostgreSQL to Version 9.6 Before Migrating to SLES12 SP3 or Later
[WARNING]
====
Before migrating the underlying system to {sle} 12 SP3 or later, you must upgrade PostgreSQL to version 9.6.

The migration needs PostgreSQL 9.4 and 9.6 installed in parallel and PostgreSQL 9.4 is only available in {sle} 12 SP2.
For more information, see pass:c[<<bp.sect.postgresql.prepare.upgrade>>].
====

{suse} offers a graphical and command line tool for upgrading to a new service pack.
Comprehensive documentation for executing service pack migration scenarios is located in the {sls} documentation chapter link:https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/cha_update_sle.html[].
