[[update.suse.manager]]
= {productname} Server Update

This update procedure covers simple package updates or a concerted micro update, which is also known as a maintenance update (MU).
During a MU the user stops services, updates packages, runs the script to update the database, and restarts services.
Example: [literal]``4.0.1`` â†’ [literal]``4.0.2``.

This means first you ensure that you have the latest version of all installed packages installed.
Then you can upgrade the database schema.

.Procedure: Updating Packages on the {productname} Server

By default, several update channels are configured and enabled for the {productname} Server.
New and updated packages will become available automatically.

. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, stop the spacewalk services:
+
----
spacewalk-service stop
----
. List available patches:
+
----
zypper list-patches
----
. Apply all available patches:
+
----
zypper patch
----


.Procedure: Upgrading the Database Schema

If a patch includes a new database schema upgrade, you will need to use the [command]``spacewalk-schema-upgrade`` command.

. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, ensure the database service is running:
+
----
systemctl start postgresql
----
. Perform the schema update:
+
----
spacewalk-schema-upgrade
----
. Restart the spacewalk services:
+
----
spacewalk-service start
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Services affected by a package update are not automatically restarted after an update.
You need to restart these services manually to avoid potential failures.
Use [command]``zypper ps`` to check for applications that are using old code and require restarting.
====

Reboot the server if a patch update recommends rebooting.
