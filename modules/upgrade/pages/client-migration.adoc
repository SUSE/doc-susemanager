= Client Migration




Upgrading from SLE{nbsp}12 with the latest service pack (SP) to SLE{nbsp}15 can be automated, but requires some preparation steps.

To upgrade the SP version on SLE{nbsp}12 (for example, upgrading from SLE{nbsp}12 or any SLE{nbsp}12{nbsp}SPx to SLE{nbsp}12{nbsp}SP4) can be fully automated and requires no additional preparation.



[[bp.client.migration.sle]]
== Upgrading SLE{nbsp}12{nbsp}SPx to Version 15

SLE{nbsp}12{nbsp}SPx clients can be auto-upgraded to SLE{nbsp}15 with {yast} auto-installation.
This also applies for other supported products based on SLE{nbsp}12.
For generally supported {sle} upgrade paths, see  https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_sle_upgrade/data/sec_upgrade-paths_supported.html ({slea} {upgrade}, Chapter "`Supported Upgrade Paths to SLE 15`").

It is important that you migrate the client to the latest available SP first.
Upgrade to SLE 12 SP4 after December 2018.

.Auto-Upgrading Salt Clients Currently Not Supported
[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure will work for traditionally  managed systems (system type [systemitem]``management``).
It is not currently available for systems using Salt (system type [systemitem]``salt``).
====

During the procedure, the machine reboots and performs the system upgrade.
The process is controlled by {yast} and {ay}, not by [command]``zypper`` commands.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only perform this migration procedure on client systems managed by {productname} servers.
For upgrading the {productname} server itself, see <<bp.sp.migration>>.
This is a viable method for major version upgrades such as an upgrade from {sle} 12 to 15.
====



[[bp.proc.client.migration.sle.prep]]
=== System Upgrade Preparation

Make sure your {productname} and all the clients you want to upgrade have installed all available updates, including the {productname} tools.
This is absolutely necessary, otherwise the system upgrade will fail.

The preparation process contains several steps:

. Download and save installation media
. Create an auto-installation distribution
. Create an activation key
. Upload an {ay} profile


.Procedure: Download and Save Installation Media
. On the {productname} server, create a local directory for the SLE{nbsp}15 installation media.
. Download an ISO image with the installation sources, and mount the ISO image on your server:
+

----
mkdir /mnt/sle15
mount -o loop DVD1.iso /mnt/sle15
----

.Procedure: Create an Auto-Installation Distribution
For all distributions you want to upgrade, create a SLE{nbsp}15 distribution in {productname}.

. In the {productname} {webui}, click menu:Main Menu[Systems > Autoinstallation > Distributions].
. Enter a [guimenu]``Distribution Label`` for your distribution (for example, ``autumn2018``)
. Specify the [guimenu]``Tree Path``, which is the root directory of the SLE{nbsp}15 installation sources (for example, [path]``/mnt/sle15``).
. For [guimenu]``Base Channel``, use the update target distribution [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SLES15-Pool for x86_64``.
. Confirm with [guimenu]``Create Autoinstallable Distribution``.

For more information about Autoinstallation, see <<ref.webui.systems.autoinst>>.


.Procedure: Create an Activation Key

In order to switch from the old SLE{nbsp}12{nbsp}SP4 base channel to the new SLE{nbsp}15 channel, you need an activation key.

. Go to menu:Main Menu[Systems > Activation Keys] and click [guimenu]``Create Key``.
. Enter a description for your key.
. Enter a key or leave it blank to generate an automatic key.
. If you want to limit the usage, enter your value in the [guimenu]``Usage`` text field.
. Select the [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SLES15-Pool for x86_64`` base channel.
. Decide about [guimenu]``Add-On System Types``.
If in doubt, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_quickstarts/data/art_modules.html ({slea} Modules & Extensions Quick Start).
. Click btn:[Create Activation Key].
. Click the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` tab and select the required channels. Finish with btn:[Update Key].

.Procedure: Upload an {ay} Profile

Create an {ay} XML file according to <<ap-sample-autoinst-system-upgrade>>.
For more information about {ay}, see <<ref.webui.systems.autoinst.ay_intro>>.

. Go to menu:Main Menu[Systems > Autoinstallation] and click [guimenu]``Upload Kickstart/Autoyast File``.
. Paste the XML content in the text area or select the file to upload and click btn:[Create].
. Add `autoupgrade=1` in the [guimenu]``Kernel Options`` of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab and click btn:[Update].
. Switch to the [guimenu]``Variable`` tab.
. In the text field `registration_key=` enter the key from the preparation above.
. Click btn:[Update Variables].


After you have successfully finished this process, you are ready to perform the upgrade.
For upgrade instruction, see <<bp.proc.client.migration.sle.upgrade>>.

.Procedure: Upgrading SLE{nbsp}12{nbsp}SPx to version 15

.Synchronizing Target Channels
WARNING: Before successfully initializing the product migration, make sure that the migration target channels are completely mirrored.
For the upgrade to {sle} 15, at least the [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SLES15-Pool`` base channel with the [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools15-Pool`` child channel for your architecture is required.
The matching update channels such as [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools15-Updates`` and [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SLES15-Updates`` are recommended.
// Checkit:
Watch the mirroring progress in [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync/sles15-pool-x86_64.log``.


. Go to the system via menu:Main Menu[Systems] and click the name of the system. Then click menu:System Details[Provisioning > Autoinstallation > Schedule], and choose the {ay} XML profile you have uploaded above.
. Click btn:[Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish].
+
Next time the machine asks the {productname} server for jobs, it will receive a reinstallation job which fetches kernel and initrd and writes a new [path]``/boot/grub/menu.lst`` (containing pointers to the new kernel and initrd).
+
When the machine boots, it will use the {grub} configuration and boots the new kernel with its initrd.
No PXE boot is required for this process.
A shutdown of the machine is initiated as well, effectively 3 minutes after the job was fetched.

[[bp.client.migration.sle12]]
== Migrating SLE{nbsp}12 or later to version 12{nbsp}SP4


Existing SLE{nbsp}12 clients (SLE) may be upgraded to SP4 with the menu:SP Migration[] procedure provided by the {webui}.
The same applies for other supported products based on {sle} 12.

.Synchronizing Target Channels
[WARNING]
====
Before successfully initializing the product migration, you first must make sure that the migration target channels are completely mirrored.
For the upgrade to SLE{nbsp}12{nbsp}SP4, at least the [systemitem]``SLES12-SP4-Pool`` base channel with the [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool`` child channel for your architecture is required.
The matching update channels such as [systemitem]``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates`` and [systemitem]``SLES12-SP4-Updates`` are recommended.
====

.Procedure: Migrating SLE{nbsp}12 Client to SP4
. Direct your browser to the {productname} {webui} where your client is registered, and login.
. On the menu:Systems[All] page select your client system from the table.
+

image::sles_old_details_page.png[scaledwidth=80%]

+
If there are menu:Software Updates Available[] in the menu:System Status[] notification install these updates first to avoid trouble during the migration process.

. On the system's detail page select the menu:Software[] tab, then the menu:SP Migration[] tab.
+

image::sles_old_details_spmigration.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. From this tab you will see the installed products listed on your client. Select the wanted menu:Target Products[] (if there is more than one), which is [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12{nbsp}SP4``.
+

image::sles_migration_target.png[scaledwidth=80%]

+
Then confirm with menu:Select Channels[].
+

image::sles_migration_channels.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Select menu:Schedule Migration[], and then menu:Confirm[].
+

image::sles_migration_schedule.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Check the menu:System Status[] on the system's details when the migration is done.

image::sles_migrated.png[scaledwidth=80%]

If the menu:System Status[] notification does not report a successful migration but lists menu:Software Updates Available[], install the update now and then check again.

Finally, consider to schedule a reboot.
