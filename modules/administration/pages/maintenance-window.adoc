= Maintenance Window Checklist

If you work on a {productname} Server with scheduled maintenance windows, you might find it difficult to remember all the things that you need to during that critical downtime.

This section contains a checklist for your maintenance window, with links to further information on performing each of the steps, if you need it.


. Stop services.
You will need to stop the spacewalk, SAP, and database services, along with any others you have running.
. Check if the configuration is still correct.
. On Salt systems, apply the highstate.
. Apply the latest updates.
See xref:upgrade:server-upgrade.adoc[].
. Update to the latest service pack, if required.
See xref:upgrade:migrate-4x-4x.adoc[].
. Reboot the server.
. Check if the configuration is still correct.
. On Salt systems, apply the highstate.
. Start any stopped services.



== Keep the Server Patched

As with any &sles; system, you are encouraged to install package updates on the {susemgr} Server when they arrive.
You install these update with {yast} online update or with ``zypper up`` or ``zypper patch``).
Preferable, you will run these commands during a maintenance window; for more information, see xref:administration:maintenance-window.adoc#maintenance-window[].

By default, several update channels are configured and enabled on the {susemgr} Server.
Thus improved packages will become available automatically.
Check whether the update channels are actually available:

From time to time, all the package updates are bundled and released as a maintenance update.
If you will install such a MU, the version number will get increased from say 4.0.1 to 4.0.2.

With zypper migration you will update from, say, versionÂ 4.0.x to 4.1.x:

This is also known as a Service Pack (SP) migration.

To keep SUMA 4 patched, you either connect directly to SCC or use RMT as a local installation source.
