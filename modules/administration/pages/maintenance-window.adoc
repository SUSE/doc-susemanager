= Maintenance Window Checklist

If you work on a {productname} Server with scheduled maintenance windows, you might find it difficult to remember all the things that you need to during that critical downtime.

As with any {sle} system, you are encouraged to install package updates on the {susemgr} Server when they arrive.

This section contains a checklist for your maintenance window, with links to further information on performing each of the steps, if you need it.


. Stop services.
You will need to stop the spacewalk, SAP, and database services, along with any others you have running.
. Check if the configuration is still correct.
. On Salt systems, apply the highstate.
. Apply the latest updates.
See xref:upgrade:server-update.adoc[].
. Update to the latest service pack, if required.
See xref:upgrade:migrate-4x-4x.adoc[].
. Reboot the server.
. Check if the configuration is still correct.
. On Salt systems, apply the highstate.
. Start any stopped services.


You can install updates using your package manager.
For information on using {yast}, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_sle_admin/data/cha_onlineupdate_you.html).
For information on using zypper, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_sle_admin/data/sec_zypper.html).

////

Preferable, you will run such a tool within a maintenance window; for more information, see xref:administration:maintenance-window.adoc#maintenance-window[].

 complete procedure, also see above:
1. Log in as root user to the SUSE Manager server.
2. Stop the Spacewalk service:
   spacewalk-service stop
3. Apply the patch using either zypper patch or YaST Online Update.
4. Upgrade the database schema:
    spacewalk-schema-upgrade
5. Start the Spacewalk service:
    spacewalk-service start

By default, several update channels are configured and enabled for the {susemgr} Server.
New and updated packages will become available automatically.

To keep {susemgr}Â up to date, you must have it connected directly to {scc}.
Alternatively, for disconnected environments, you can use {rmtool} (RMT) as a local installation source.

You can check that the update channels are available on your system with this command:

----
zypper lr
----

The output will look similar to this:

{productname} releases maintenance updates (MUs) to provide newer packages.
Maintenance updates are indicated with a new version number.
For example, the major release 4.0 will be incremented to 4.0.1 when an MU is released.

You can verify which version you are running by looking at the bottom of the navigation bar in the {webui}.
You can also fetch the version number with the [literal]``api.getVersion()`` XMLRPC API call.

To upgrade to the latest MU, you can use the [command]``zypper migration`` command at the command prompt:

----
zypper migration
----

This procedure is also known as a Service Pack (SP) migration.
