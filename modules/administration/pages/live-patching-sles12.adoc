= Live Patching on {slsa}{nbsp}12


On {slsa}{nbsp}12 systems, live patching is managed by kGraft.
For in depth information covering kGraft use, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_sle_admin/book_sle_admin.html#cha.kgraft.

Before you begin, ensure:

* {productname} is fully updated
* You have one or more Salt clients running {slsa}{nbsp}12 (SP1 or later)
* Your {slsa}{nbsp}12 Salt clients are registered with {productname}
* You have access to the {slsa}{nbsp}12 channels appropriate for your architecture, including the Live Patching child channel (or channels)
* The clients are fully synchronized

.Procedure: Setting up for Live Patching

. Select the client you want to manage with Live Patching from menu:Systems[Overview], and on the system details page navigate to the menu:Software[Packages > Install] tab.
Search for the [systemitem]``kgraft`` package, and install it.
+

. Apply the highstate to enable Live Patching, and reboot the client.
. Repeat for each client that you want to manage with Live Patching.
. To check that Live Patching has been enabled correctly, select the client from menu:Systems[System List], and ensure that [systemitem]``Live Patching`` appears in the [guimenu]``Kernel`` field.


When you have the Live Patching channel installed on the client, you can clone the default vendor channel.
This cloned channel will be used to manage Live Patching on your clients.

Cloned vendor channels should be prefixed by ``dev`` for development, ``testing``, or  ``prod`` for production.
In this procedure, you will create a ``dev`` cloned channel, and later, you will need to promote the channel to ``testing``.


.Procedure: Cloning Live Patching Channels

. At the command prompt on the client, as `root`, obtain the current package channel tree:
+
----
# spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --list-channels
Spacewalk Username: admin
Spacewalk Password:
Channel tree:

 1. sles12-sp4-pool-x86_64
      \__ sle-live-patching12-pool-x86_64-sp4
      \__ sle-live-patching12-updates-x86_64-sp4
      \__ sle-manager-tools12-pool-x86_64-sp4
      \__ sle-manager-tools12-updates-x86_64-sp4
      \__ sles12-sp4-updates-x86_64
----
. Use the [command]``spacewalk-manage-channel`` command with the [option]``init`` argument to automatically create a new development clone of the original vendor channel:
+
----
spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --init -c sles12-sp4-pool-x86_64
----
. Check that [systemitem]``dev-sles12-sp4-updates-x86_64`` is available in your channel list.

Check the ``dev`` cloned channel you created, and remove any kernel updates that require a reboot.

.Procedure: Removing Non-Live Kernel Patches from Cloned Channels

. Check the current kernel version by selecting the client from menu:Systems[System List], and taking note of the version displayed in the [guimenu]``Kernel`` field.
. In the {productname} {webui}, select the client from menu:Systems[Overview], navigate to the menu:Software[Manage > Channels] tab, and select [systemitem]``dev-sles12-sp4-updates-x86_64``.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Patches`` tab, and click btn:[List/Remove Patches].
. In the search bar, type [systemitem]``kernel`` and identify the kernel version that matches the kernel currently used by your client.
. Remove all kernel versions that are newer than the currently installed kernel.

Your channel is now set up for Live Patching, and can be promoted to ``testing``.
In this procedure, you will also add the Live Patching child channels to your client, ready to be applied.

.Procedure: Promoting Live Patching Channels

. At the command prompt on the client, as `root`, promote and clone the `dev-sles12-sp4-pool-x86_64` channel to a new testing channel:
+
----
# spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --promote -c dev-sles12-sp4-pool-x86_64
----
. In the {productname} {webui}, select the client from menu:Systems[Overview], and navigate to the menu:Software[Software Channels] tab.
. Check the new [systemitem]``test-sles12-sp4-pool-x86_64`` custom channel to change the base channel, and check both corresponding Live Patching child channels.
. Click btn:[Next], confirm that the details are correct, and click btn:[Confirm] to save the changes.

You can now select and view available CVE patches, and apply these important kernel updates with Live Patching.

.Procedure: Applying Live Patches to a Kernel

. In the {productname} {webui}, select the client from menu:Systems[Overview].
You will see a banner at the top of the screen showing the number of critical and non-critical packages available for the client:
+
image::live_patching_criticalupdates.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Click btn:[Critical] to see a list of the available critical patches.
. Select any patch with a synopsis reading [guimenu]``Important: Security update for the Linux kernel``.
Security bugs will also include their CVE number, where applicable.
. OPTIONAL: If you know the CVE number of a patch you want to apply, you can search for it in menu:Audit[CVE Audit], and apply the patch to any clients that require it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Not all kernel patches are Live Patches!
Non-Live kernel patches are represented by a `Reboot Required` icon located next to the `Security` shield icon.
These patches will always require a reboot.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Not all security issues can be fixed by applying a live patch.
Some security issues can only be fixed by applying a full kernel update and will require a reboot.
The assigned CVE numbers for these issues are not included in live patches.
A CVE audit will display this requirement.
