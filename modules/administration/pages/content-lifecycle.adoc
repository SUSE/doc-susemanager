= Content Lifecycle Management






Content Lifecycle Management allows you to customize and test packages before updating production systems.
This is especially useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window.

Content Lifecycle Management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production systems.

While you cannot directly modify vendor channels, you can clone them and then modify the clones by adding or removing packages and custom patches.
You can then assign these cloned channels to test systems to ensure they work as expected and, once all tests pass, apply them to production servers.

This is achieved through a series of environments that your software channels can move through on their lifecycle.
Most environment lifecycles include at least test and production environments, but you can have as many environments as you require.

. In the [guimenu]``name`` field, enter a descriptive name for your project.
. Click the btn:[Create] button to create your project and return to the project page.
. Click btn:[Add new Source].
. In the [guimenu]``Sources`` dialog, select the source type, and select a base channel for your project.
The available child channels for the selected base channel will be displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended.
. Check the child channels you require, and click btn:[Save] to return to the project page.
The software channels you selected should now be showing.
. Click btn:[Add new Environment].
. In the [guimenu]``Environment Lifecycle`` dialog, give the first environment a name and a description, and click btn:[Save].
The [guimenu]``name`` field only accepts lowercase letters, numbers, periods (``.``), hyphens (``-``) and underscores (``_``).
. Continue creating environments until you have all the  environments for your lifecycle completed.
You can select the order of the environments in the lifecycle by selecting an environment in the [guimenu]``Insert before`` field when you create it.
