= Troubleshooting Package Inconsistencies






In some cases, updates are available in the web interface, but not appearing on the client.
If you schedule an update on the client, it will fail with an error stating that no updates are available.
This can be caused by a metadata regeneration problem, or because update packages have been locked.

The notice that updates are available will appear immediately, but new metadata is only generated on the server after synchronizing.
In this case, an inconsistency can occur if taskomatic crashes, or because taskomatic is still running and creating new metadata.

To address this issue, check the [path]``/var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log`` file to determine if any processess are still running, or an exception which could indicate a crash.
In the case of a crash, restart taskomatic.

Check package locks and exclude lists to determine if packages are locked or excluded on the client:

On Expanded Support Platform, check [path]``/etc/yum.conf`` and search for ``exclude=``.

On SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, use the [command]``zypper locks`` command.
