= Tuning Changelogs

Some packages have a long list of changelog entries.
This data is downloaded by default, but is very rarely useful information.
In order to limit the amount of changelog metadata which is downloaded and to save disk space, you can put a limit on how many entries to keep on disk.

This configuration option is in the [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file.
The parameter defaults to [systemitem]``0``, which means unlimited.

----
java.max_changelog_entries = 0

When you set this parameter, it will come into effect only when packages are synchronized.
You might like to delete the cached data to remove older data.
