[[reports]]
= Generate Reports

The [command]``spacewalk-report`` command is used to produce a variety of reports.
These reports can be helpful for taking inventory of your entitlements, subscribed systems, users, and organizations.
Using reports is often simpler than gathering information manually from the {susemgr} {webui}, especially if you have many systems under management.

To generate reports, you must have the [package]``spacewalk-reports`` package installed.

The [command]``spacewalk-report`` command allows you to organize and display reports about content, systems, and user resources across {productname}.

You can generate reports on:

. System Inventory: list all the systems registered to {productname}.
. Entitlements: list all organizations, sorted by system or channel entitlements.
. Patches: list all the patches relevant to the registered systems and sorts patches by severity, as well as the systems that apply to a particular patch.
. Users: list all registered users and any systems associated with a particular user.

To get the report in CSV format, run this command at the command prompt on the server:

----
spacewalk-report <report_name>
----

This table lists the available reports:
