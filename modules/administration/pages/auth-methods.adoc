== Authentication Via PAM

{productname} supports network-based authentication systems via Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).
PAM is a suite of libraries that allows you to integrate {productname} with a centralized authentication mechanism, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords.
{productname} supports LDAP, Kerberos, and other network-based authentication systems via PAM.



=== Enable PAM

. Create a PAM service file.
PAM service files are located in [path]``/etc/pam.d/susemanager`` by default.
Enforce its use by adding this line to [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:
+

----
pam_auth_service = susemanager
----
+
NOTE: This assumes the PAM service file is named [path]``susemanager``.
+

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Create User[] and enable a new or existing user to authenticate with PAM
. Check the [guimenu]``Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)`` checkbox.
It is below the password and password confirmation fields.
. To authenticate a {slsa} system against Kerberos, add these lines to [path]``/etc/pam.d/susemanager``:
+

----
#%PAM-1.0
auth     include        common-auth
account  include        common-account
password include        common-password
session  include        common-session
----
+
To authenticate a {rhel} system against Kerberos, add these lines to [path]``/etc/pam.d/susemanager``:

----
#%PAM-1.0
auth        required      pam_env.so
auth        sufficient    pam_krb5.so no_user_check
auth        required      pam_deny.so
account     required      pam_krb5.so no_user_check
----
+

YaST can be used to configure PAM.
You will need to install the [package]``yast2-ldap-client`` and [package]``yast2-kerberos-client`` packages.
For more information about configuring PAM, see the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Security Guide https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_security/data/part_auth.html.
This is a generic example that will also work for other network-based authentication methods.
+
.Changing Passwords
IMPORTANT: Changing the password on the {productname} {webui} changes only the local password on the {productname} Server.
If PAM is enabled for that user, the password might not be used at all.
In the above example, for instance, the Kerberos password will not be changed.



=== Authentication with eDirectory and PAM

. First check to ensure eDirectory authentication is working with your current OS for example:
+

----
getent passwd
----
. If users are returned from eDirectory then create the [filename]``/etc/pam.d/susemanager`` and add the following content:
+

----
#%PAM-1.0
auth     include        common-auth
account  include        common-account
password include        common-password
session  include        common-session
----

. Add these lines to the {productname} configuration file at [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:
+

----
pam_auth_service = susemanager
----

You can now create users with the same ID used by eDirectory, and check the [guimenu]``Use PAM`` checkbox in the {productname} {webui}.



// === Example Quest VAS Active Directory Authentication Template


// If you are using Quest VAS for active directory authentication, you can use this [path]``/etc/pam.d/susemanager`` file.

.Example of Quest VAS Active Directory Authentication Template
----
#%PAM-1.0
auth       required       pam_env.so
auth       sufficient     pam_vas3.so no_user_check
auth       requisite      pam_vas3.so echo_return
auth       required       pam_deny.so
account    required       pam_vas3.so no_user_check
----



== Authentication Via Single Sign-On (SSO)

[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature is provided as a technical preview.
It is not supported for use in production environments.
====

{productname} supports single sign-on (SSO) by implementing the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML){nbsp}2 protocol.

Single sign-on is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of credentials.
SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.
A SAML identity service provider (IdP) provides authentication and authorization services to service providers (SP), such as {productname}.
{productname} exposes three endpoints which must be enabled for single sign-on.

SSO in {productname} supports:

* Log in with SSO.
* Log out with service provider-initiated single logout (SLO), and Identity service provider single logout service (SLS).
* Assertion and nameId encryption.
* Assertion signatures.
* Message signatures with AuthNRequest, LogoutRequest, and LogoutResponses.
* Enable an Assertion consumer service endpoint.
* Enable a single logout service endpoint.
* Publish the SP metadata (which can be signed).

SSO in {productname} does not support:

* Product choosing and implementation for the Identity Service Provider (IdP).
* SAML support for other products (check with the respective product documentation).



=== Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have configured an external Identity Service Provider with these parameters.
Check your IdP documentation for instructions.

You will need these endpoints:

* Assertion Consumer Service (or ACS): an endpoint to accept SAML messages to establish a session into the Service Provider.
The endpoint for ACS in {productname} is: https://example.com/rhn/manager/sso/acs
* Single Logout Service (or SLS): an endpoint to initiate a logout request from the IdP.
The endpoint for SLS in {productname} is: https://example.com/rhn/manager/sso/sls
* Metadata: an endpoint to retrieve {productname} metadata for SAML.
The endpoint for Metadata in {productname} is: https://example.com/rhn/manager/sso/metadata

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your IdP must have a SAML:Attribute containing the username of the IdP user domain, called `uid`.
The `uid` attribute passed in the SAML:Attribute must be created in the {productname} user base before you activate single sign-on.
====

After the authentication with the IdP using the user `orgadmin` is successful, you will be logged in into {productname} as the `orgadmin` user, provided that the `orgadmin` user exists in {productname}.



=== Enable SOO

[NOTE]
====
Using SSO is mutually exclusive with other types of authentication: it is either enabled or disabled.
SSO is disabled by default.
====

.Procedure: Enabling SSO

. If your users do not yet exist in {productname}, create them first.
. Edit `/etc/rhn/rhn.conf` and add this line at the end of the file:
+
----
java.sso = true
----
. Find the parameters you want to customize in `/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf`.
Insert the parameters you want to customize into `/etc/rhn/rhn.conf` and prefix them with `java.sso.`.
+
For example, in `/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf` find:
+
----
onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs
----
+
In order to customize it, create the corresponding option in `/etc/rhn/rhn.conf` by prefixing the option name with `java.sso.`:
+
----
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs
----
+
To find all the occurrences you need to change, search in the file for the placeholders [literal]``YOUR-PRODUCT`` and [literal]```YOUR-IDP-ENTITY``.
Every parameter comes with a brief explanation of what it is meant for.
. Restart the spacewalk service to pick up the changes:
+
----
spacewalk-service restart
----

When you visit the {productname} URL, you will be redirected to the IdP for SSO where you will be requested to authenticate.
Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected to the {productname} {webui}, logged in as the authenticated user.
If you encounter problems with logging in using SSO, check the {productname} logs for more information.
