= Monitoring with Prometheus

Monitoring can be performed in {productname} using Prometheus and Grafana.
The packages for Prometheus are shipped with SUSE Manager Client Tools, these packages also include several Prometheus exporters.
{productname} Server and Proxy are now able to provide self-health metrics, or install and manage a limited number of Prometheus exporters on managed client systems.

// I do not see why we should mention where this was started; we do not do this elsewhere
Prometheus is a monitoring tool that is used to record real-time metrics in a time-series database.
Unlike other monitoring systems, Prometheus collects metrics using HTTP pulls, allowing for higher performance and scalability.
Prometheus is an open-source software project, mostly written in Go.
Its source code is available at https://github.com/prometheus/.

Grafana is a tool for data visualization, monitoring, and analysis.
It is used to create dashboards with panels representing specific metrics over a set period of time.
Grafana is commonly used together with Prometheus, but also supports other data sources such as ElasticSearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Influx DB.
For more information about Grafana, see https://grafana.com/docs/.

A Prometheus package is included in the SUSE Manager Client Tools for {sle}{nbsp}12 and {sle}{nbsp}15.



== Prometheus Metrics

Prometheus metrics are time series data, or timestamped values belonging to the same group or dimension.
A metric is uniquely identified by its name and set of labels.

// TODO:: This should be an actual image.

----
   metric name               labels                 timestamp     value
┌────────┴───────┐  ┌───────────┴───────────┐    ┌──────┴──────┐  ┌─┴─┐
http_requests_total{status="200", method="GET"}  @1557331801.111  42236
----

Each application or system being monitored must expose metrics in the format above, either through code instrumentation or Prometheus exporters.

The different metric types are:

* Counter - cumulative values. For example, number of errors
* Gauge - can go up or down. For example, temperature
* Histogram - count observations in buckets
* Summary - similar to histogram, but provides totals (sum and count)

For more information about metric types, see https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/.



== PromQL

Prometheus has its own query language called PromQL, which is a functional expression language.
PromQL allows you to filter multi-dimensional time series data.
It is used in all Prometheus interactions.

In PromQL, an expression can evaluate to one of three types:

* Instant vector: a set of time series containing a single sample for each time series, all sharing the same timestamp
* Range vector: a set of time series containing a range of data points over time for each time series
* Scalar: a numeric floating point value

The core part of any PromQL query is the metric name, for example, *http_requests_total*.
Labels can be used as optional selectors.
This example returns the total number of HTTP requests that have status *200* and method *GET*:

----
http_requests_total{status="200", method="GET"}
----

For more information about PromQL, see the official Prometheus documentation at https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/.



== Exporters

Exporters are libraries that help with exporting metrics from third-party systems as Prometheus metrics.
Exporters are useful whenever it is not feasible to instrument a given application or system with Prometheus metrics directly.
Multiple exporters can run on a monitored host to export local metrics.

The Prometheus community provides a list of official exporters, and more can be found as community contributions.
For detailed information and an extensive list of exporters, see https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/.

With {productname}{nbsp}4, you can set up the Server and Proxy to expose Prometheus metrics to provide insights about self-health of {productname}.
Metrics are available for these services:

* Hardware and Operating System
* Java Virtual Machines
* Apache
* Squid
* PostgreSQL
* {productname} internals

The self-health metrics are made available by {productname} Java application combined with Prometheus standalone exporters, running as systemd daemons.

{productname} requires these packages to be installed on the Server and the Proxy.
The packages are shipped with {productname} Server and Proxy, but their respective systemd daemons are disabled by default.

These exporter packages are shipped with {productname} Server:

* Node exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter``.
See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter.
* PostgreSQL exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-wrouesnel-postgres_exporter``.
See https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter.
* JMX exporter: [systemitem]``prometheus-jmx_exporter``.
See https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter.
* Apache exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-lusitaniae-apache_exporter``.
See https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter.

These exporter packages are shipped with {productname} Proxy:

* Node exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter``.
See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter.
* Squid exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-boynux-squid_exporter``.
See https://github.com/boynux/squid-exporter.



== Install and Configure Prometheus

Prometheus is installed from a package, and needs configuration before you can use it to gather metrics.



=== Installing Prometheus

.Procedure: Installing Prometheus
. Install the [package]``golang-github-prometheus-prometheus`` package:
+
----
zypper in golang-github-prometheus-prometheus
----
. Enable the Prometheus service:
+
----
systemctl enable --now prometheus
----
. Check that the Prometheus interface is loading correctly.
In your browser, navigate to the URL of the server where Prometheus is installed, and listen on port 9090 (for example, [literal]``http://example.com:9090``).



=== Configuring Prometheus

Prometheus requires some configuration to collect metrics and set up alarms, or to display metrics graphically in Grafana.
You can configure Prometheus in the static configuration file at [path]``/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml``.
It is important to understand how this file is structured.
For example:

----
yaml
- job_name: 'suse-manager-server'
  static_configs:
    - targets:
      - 'suse-manager.local:9100'  # Node exporter
      - 'suse-manager.local:9187'  # PostgreSQL exporter
      - 'suse-manager.local:5556'  # JMX exporter (Tomcat)
      - 'suse-manager.local:5557'  # JMX exporter (Taskomatic)
      - 'suse-manager.local:9800'  # Taskomatic
    - targets:
      - 'suse-manager.local:80'    # Message queue
      labels:
        __metrics_path__: /rhn/metrics
----

For more information about configuring Prometheus, see the official Prometheus documentation at https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/



== Monitoring Managed Systems

Prometheus metrics exporters can also be used on managed client systems.
The packages are available from the {productname} client tools channels, and can be enabled and configured directly on the {productname} {webui}.
Currently, two exporters are supported:

* Node exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter``.
See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter.
* PostgreSQL exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-wrouesnel-postgres_exporter``.
See https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter.

Installing and configuring exporters is done using a Salt formula.
