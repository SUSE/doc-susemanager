= Channel Management

Channels are a method of grouping software packages.

In {productname}, channels are grouped into base and child channels, with base channels grouped by operating system type, version, and architecture, and child channels being compatible with their related base channel.
When a system has been assigned to a base channel, it is only possible for that system to install the related child channels.
Organizing channels in this way ensures that only compatible packages are installed on each system.

While {productname} provides all required channels, you might find it useful to create custom channels specific to your environment.
{productname} Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority, which gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels.

[NOTE]
====
When you subscribe to a vendor channel with a traditional client, the product package will automatically be installed.
On Salt clients, the packages will be added to the package state, and you will need to apply the highstate to push the changes to your systems.

This section gives more detail on how to create, administer, and delete custom channels.



== Creating Custom Channels

If you have custom software packages that you need to install on your {productname} systems, you can create a custom child channel to manage them.
You will need to create the channel in the {productname} {webui} and create a repository for the packages, before assigning the channel to your systems.

If you include a package with [systemitem]``-release`` at the end of the package name in your channel, it will be automatically installed when the channel is installed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system.
====



.Procedure: Create a custom channel

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], and click btn:[Create Channel].
. On the [guimenu]``Create Software Channel`` page, give your channel a name (for example, [systemitem]``My Tools SLES 15 SP1 x86_64``) and a label (for example, [systemitem]``my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64``).
Note that labels cannot contain space characters or capital letters.
. In the [guimenu]``Parent Channel`` drop down, choose the relevant base channel (for example [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SLES15-SP1-Pool for x86_64``).
Ensure that you choose the compatible parent channel for your packages.
. In the [guimenu]``Architecture`` drop down, choose the appropriate hardware architecture (for example, [systemitem]``x86_64``).
. Provide any additional information in the contact details, channel access control, and GPG fields, as required for your environment.
. Click btn:[Create Channel]

.Procedure: Create a software repository

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Repositories], and click btn:[Create Repository].
. On the [guimenu]``Create Repository`` page, give your repository a label (for example, [systemitem]``my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo``).
. In the [guimenu]``Repository URL`` field, provide the path to the folder that contains the [path]``repodata`` file (for example, [systemitem]``file:///opt/mytools/``).
You can use any valid addressing protocol in this field.
. Uncheck the [guimenu]``Has Signed Metadata?`` check box.
. Provide any additional information in the SSL fields, as required for your environment.
. Click btn:[Create Repository]
. Synchronize your new repository with your custom channel by navigating to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], clicking on the name of your newly created custom channel, and navigating to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab.
. Ensure the repository you want to synchronize is checked, and click btn:[Update Repositories].
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` tab and click btn:[Sync Now] to synchronize immediately.
You can also set an automated synchronization schedule on this tab.

.Procedure: Add custom channels to an activation key

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys], and select the key you want to add the custom channel to.
. On the [guiemnu]``Details`` tab, in the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` listing, select the channel to associate.
You can select multiple channels, if you need to.
. Click btn:[Update Activation Key].



== Deleting Custom Channels

You cannot delete {productname} channels.
Only custom channels can be deleted.

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], and select the channel you want to delete.
. Click btn:[Delete software channel].
. On the [guimenu]``Delete Channel`` page, check the details of the channel you are deleting, and check the [guimenu]``Unsubscribe Systems`` checkbox to remove the custom channel from any systems that might still be subscribed.
. Click btn:[Delete Channel].

When channels are deleted, the packages that are part of the deleted channel are not automatically removed.
If you try to update packages that have had their channel deleted, it can cause errors.
In this case, you will need to manually remove the packages.
Packages can be manually removed in the {productname} {webui} by going to menu:Systems[Systems > All] and selecting the system, navigating to the menu:States[Packages] tab, and setting the package state to [guimenu]``Removed``.
Note that removing the package using a command line package manager or the [guimenu]``Software`` menu will not permanently remove the package.
