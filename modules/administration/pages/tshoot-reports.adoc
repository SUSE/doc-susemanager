The [command]``spacewalk-report`` command is used to produce a variety of reports for system administrators.
These reports can be helpful for taking inventory of your entitlements, subscribed systems, users, and organizations.
Using reports is often simpler than gathering information manually from the {susemgr} {webui}, especially if you have many systems under management.
