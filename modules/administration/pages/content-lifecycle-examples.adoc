= Content Lifecycle Management Examples

This section contains some common examples of how you can use content lifecycle management.
Use these examples to build your own personalized implementation.



[#create-proj-for-patch-cycle]
== Creating a Project for a Monthly Patch Cycle

An example project for a monthly patch cycle consists of:

* Creating a `By Date` filter
* Adding the filter to the project
* Applying the filter to a new project build
* Excluding a patch from the project
* Including a patch in the project



[#create-a-filter]
=== Creating a `By Date` filter

The ``By Date`` filter excludes all patches released after a specified date.
This filter is useful for your content lifecycle projects that follow a monthly patch cycle.


.Procedure: Creating the ``By Date`` Filter
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Filters] and click btn:[Create Filter].

. In the [guimenu]``Filter Name`` field, type a name for your filter.
For example, [systemitem]``Exclude patches by date``.

. In the [guimenu]``Filter Type`` field, select [guimenu]``Patch (Issue date)``.

. In the [guimenu]``Matcher`` field, [guimenu]``later or equal`` is autoselected.

. Select the date and time.

. Click btn:[Save].



[#add-filter-to-proj]
=== Adding the Filter to the Project

.Procedure: Adding a Filter to a Project
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Projects] and select a project from the list.

. Click btn:[Attach/Detach Filters] link to see all available filters

. Select the new [guimenu]``Exclude patches by date`` filter.

. Click btn:[Save].



[#apply-filter-to-project-build]
=== Applying the Filter to a new Project Build

The new filter is added to your filter list, but it still needs to be applied to the project.
To apply the filter you need to build the first environment.

.Procedure: Using the Filter
Click btn:[Build] to build the first environment.

. OPTIONAL: Add a message.
You can use messages to help track the build history.

. Check that the filter has worked correctly by using the new channels on a test server.

. Click btn:[Promote] to move the content to the next environment.
The build will take longer if you have a large number of filters, or they are very complex.



[#exclude-a-patch]
=== Excluding a Patch from the Project

Tests may help you discover issues.
When an issue is found, exclude the problem patch released before the `by date` filter.

.Procedure: Excluding a Patch

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Filters] and click btn:[Create Filter].

. In the [guimenu]``Filter Name`` field, enter a name for the filter.
For example, [systemitem]``Exclude openjdk patch``.
. In the [guimenu]``Filter Type`` field, select [guimenu]``Patch (Advisory Name)``.

. In the [guimenu]``Matcher`` field, select [guimenu]``equals``.

. In the [guimenu]``Advisory Name`` field, type a name for the advisory.
For example, [systemitem]``SUSE-15-2019-1807``.

. Click btn:[Save].

. Navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Projects] and select your project.

. Click btn:[Attach/Detach Filters] link, select [guimenu]``Exclude openjdk patch``, and click btn:[Save].

When you rebuild the project with the btn:[Build] button, the new filter is used together with the [guimenu]``by date`` filter we added before.



[#include-a-patch]
=== Including a Patch in the Project

In this example, you have received a security alert.
An important security patch was released several days after the first of the month you are currently working on.
The name of the new patch is ``SUSE-15-2019-2071``.
You need to include this new patch into your environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The [guimenu]``Allow`` filters rule overrides the exclude function of the [guimenu]``Deny`` filter rule.
For more information, see xref:administration:content-lifecycle.adoc[].
====

.Procedure: Including a Patch in a Project
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Filters] and click btn:[Create Filter].

. In the [guimenu]``Filter Name`` field, type a name for the filter.
For example, [systemitem]``Include kernel security fix``.

. In the [guimenu]``Filter Type`` field, select [guimenu]``Patch (Advisory Name)``.

. In the [guimenu]``Matcher`` field, select [guimenu]``equals``.

. In the [guimenu]``Advisory Name`` field, type [guimenu]``SUSE-15-2019-2071``, and check [guimenu]``Allow``.

. Click btn:[Save] to store the filter.

. Navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Projects] and select your project from the list.

. Click btn:[Attach/Detach Filters], and select [guimenu]``Include kernel security patch``.

. Click btn:[Save].

. Click btn:[Build] to rebuild the environment.



[#update-a-patch-cycle]
== Update an Existing Monthly Patch Cycle

When a monthly patch cycle is complete, you can update the patch cycle for the next month.

.Procedure: Updating a Monthly Patch Cycle
. In the [guimenu]``by date`` field, change the date of the filter to the next month.
Alternatively, create a new filter and change the assignment to the project.

. Check if the exclude filter for ``SUSE-15-2019-1807`` can be detached from the project.
There may be a new patch available to fix this issue.

. Detach the ``allow`` filter you added previously.
The patch is included by default.

. Rebuild the project to create a new environment with patches for the next month.



[#enhance-project-with-livepatching]
== Enhance a Project with Live Patching

This section covers setting up filters to create environments for live patching.

[IMPORTANT]
====

When you are preparing to use live patching, there are some important considerations

* Only ever use one kernel version on your systems.
The live patching packages are installed with a specific kernel.

* Live patching updates are shipped as one patch.

* Each kernel patch that begins a new series of live patching kernels will display the ``required reboot`` flag.
These kernel patches come with live patching tools.
When you have installed them, you will need to reboot the system at least once before the next year.

* Only install live patch updates that match the installed kernel version.

* Live patches are provided as stand-alone patches.
You must exclude all regular kernel patches with higher kernel version than the currently installed one.
====



[#exclude-higher-kernel-version]
=== Exclude Packages with a Higher Kernel Version

In this example you update your systems with the ``SUSE-15-2019-1244`` patch.
This patch contains ``kernel-default-4.12.14-150.17.1-x86_64``.

You need to exclude all patches which contain a higher version of ``kernel-default``.

Procedure: Excluding Packages with a Higher Kernel Version

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Filters], and click btn:[Create Filter].

. In the [guimenu]``Filter Name`` field, type a name for your filter.
For example, [systemitem]``Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1``.

. In the [guimenu]``Filter Type`` field, select [guimenu]``Patch (Contains Package)``.

. In the [guimenu]``Matcher`` field, select [guimenu]``version greater than``.

. In the [guimenu]``Package Name`` field, type [systemitem]``kernel-default``.
. Leave the the [guimenu]``Epoch`` field empty.
. In the [guimenu]``Version`` field, type [systemitem]``4.12.14``.
. In the [guimenu]``Release`` field, type [systemitem]``150.17.1``.

. Click btn:[Save] to store the filter.

. Navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Projects] and select your project.

. Click btn:[Attach/Detach Filters].

. Select [guimenu]``Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1``, and click btn:[Save].


When you click btn:[Build], a new environment is created.
The new environment contains all the kernel patches up to the version you installed.

NOTE: All kernel patches with higher kernel versions are removed. Live patching kernels
will stay available as long as they are not the first in a series.



[#update-project-for-next-patch-month]
== Update the Project for Next Patch Month

// WIP Joseph
To update the project to the next patch month you operate similar to the case before.
Important is, that you do not change the "Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1: ..."
Filter. With it you keep normal kernel-updates away, but take the latest live patches
up to the selected month.



[#switch-kernel-version-for-live-patching]
== Switch to a New Kernel Version for Live Patching

Live Patching for a specific kernel version is only available for one year. After one year
you must update the kernel on your systems. The following changes of the environment
should be executed:

.Procedure: Switch to a New Kernel Version
. Decide which kernel version you will upgrade to. For example: `4.12.14-150.32.1`
. Create a new kernel version Filter.
. Detach the previous filter **Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1** and attach the new filter.

Click btn:[Build] to rebuild the environment.
The new environment contains all kernel patches up to the new kernel version you selected.
Systems using these channels will have the kernel update available for installation.
You will need to reboot systems after they have performed the upgrade.
The new kernel will remain valid for one year.
All packages installed during the year will match the current live patching kernel filter.
