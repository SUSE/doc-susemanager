= Introduction to Retail Formulas


Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your {smr} installation.

You can use the {productname} {webui} to apply common {productname} formulas.
For the most commonly used formulas, see xref:salt:formulas-intro.adoc[].

Alternatively, you can use pre-written formulas as a starting point for your own custom formulas.
Pre-written formulas are available from https://github.com/saltstack-formulas.
For more information on custom formulas, see xref:salt:salt-formulas-custom.adoc[].

All formulas must be accurately configured for your {smr} installation to function correctly.
If you are unsure of the correct formula configuration details, run the [command]``retail_branch_init`` command before you begin to create the recommended formula configuration.
You can then manually edit the formulas as required.


.State and Formula Name Collisions
[IMPORTANT]
====
If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide, and could result in the formula being used instead of the state.
Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions.
====

Most formulas can be updated using the {susemgr} {webui}.
When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate.
The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services.
