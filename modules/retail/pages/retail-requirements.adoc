.Network Requirements

* The {susemgr} Server requires a reliable and fast WAN connection.
* The branch server requires a reliable WAN connection, to reach the {susemgr} Server.
* If you are using a shared network, ensure that DHCP requests are filtered before reaching the rest of your shared network.
* If you are using a dedicated network, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one connected to the WAN with reachable {susemgr} server, and one connected to the internal branch LAN.
* Terminals require a LAN connection to the branch server network.
