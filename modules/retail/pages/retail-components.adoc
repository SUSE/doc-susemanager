[[retail-components]]
= Components

{smr} uses a layered architecture:

* The first layer contains the {susemgr} server and one or more build hosts.
* The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services.
* The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-service terminals.

[[retail.sect.components.central-server]]
== {susemgr} Server

The {susemgr} server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals.
This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more.



[[retail.sect.components.build-hosts]]
== Build Hosts

Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines.
They are used to securely build operating system images.
Build hosts should be based on {sls}{nbsp}12 SP3 or SP4.



[[retail.sect.components.branch-server]]
== Branch Server

Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office.
We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals.
Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages).
The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services.

The branch server can operate in several different network configurations:

* The branch server has a dedicated network interface card and terminals use an isolated internal branch network.
  In this configuration, the branch server manages the internal network and provides DHCP, DNS, PXE, FTP, and TFTP services.
* The branch server shares a network with the terminals, and provides a connection to the {susemgr} server.
  In this configuration, the branch server is not required to manage a network (DHCP and DNS services), but acts as a PXE boot server and provides FTP and TFTP services.

For more information on {smr} Branch servers, see documentation on {susemgr} Proxy servers (xref:installation/install-proxy-unified.adoc[]).



[[retail.sect.components.pos-terminals]]
== Point-of-Service Terminals

Point-of-Service (PoS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems.
Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware.
{smr} accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use.

In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly.
For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display.
While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images to ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

The minimum memory requirement is 1024 MB for hosts that need to run OS images built with Kiwi (PXE booted or not)

*Hardware Requirements for PoS Terminals:*
. At least 1Â GB of RAM.
For more information, see the documentation of the underlying system (in this case: {sls}{nbsp}12).
. Disk space depending on the image size.

For more information on {smr} PoS terminals, see documentation on {susemgr} Salt clients (xref:client-configuration/client-config-overview.adoc[]).

{smr} supports PoS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI.
For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula.
For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see xref:retail:retail-formula-saltboot.adoc[].



[[retail.sect.components.fitting]]
== Fitting It All Together

{smr} uses the same technology as {susemgr}, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations.



[[retail.sect.components.fitting.hardware-types]]
=== Hardware Types

Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, {smr} uses hardware types to simplify device management.

Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name, so that all devices of a particular type can be managed as one.



[[retail.sect.components.fitting.formulas]]
=== Salt Formulas

{smr} uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration.
Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation.

You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups.
{smr} uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals.

You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment.

For more information about formulas, see xref:retail:retail-formulas.adoc[].



[[retail.sect.components.fitting.system-groups]]
=== System groups

{smr} uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment.

Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the PoS terminals associated with that server.
Each system group is identified with a Branch ID, which is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group.
