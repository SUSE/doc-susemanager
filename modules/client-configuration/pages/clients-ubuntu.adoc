Support for {ubuntu} Clients was added in {susemgr} 3.2.
Currently, Salt minions running {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS are supported.

[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} clients must be Salt minions.
Traditional clients are not supported.
====

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {ubuntu} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.
However, the root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default, so in order to use bootstrapping, you will require an existing user with [command]``sudo`` privileges for Python.

Other supported features:

* Synchronizing [systemitem]``.deb`` channels
* Assigning [systemitem]``.deb`` channels to minions
* GPG signing [systemitem]``.deb`` repositories
* Information displayed in System details pages
* Package install, update, and remove
* Package install using [systemitem]``Package States``
* Configuration and state channels

Some actions are not yet supported:

* Patch and errata support
* Bare metal installations, PXE booting, and virtual host provisioning
* Live patching
* CVE Audit
* If you use are using a repository from storage media (`server.susemanager.fromdir = ...` option in rhn.conf), Ubuntu Client Tools will not work.
// Reason: RMT and SMT cannot mirror Debian repositories (yet) and so cannot create it in that directory the correct files.
// We are waiting for SMT to release the feature/fix to mirror Debian repositories. When this has been done, this comment and the limitation above can be removed.


This section describes how to manually prepare {ubuntu} clients for registration to your {susemgr} Server and synchronize the repositories.

.Procedure: Preparing an {Ubuntu} 16.04 Client for Registration

. On the client, open the [filename]``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/suma_client_tools.list`` file, and add this line:
+
----
deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/saltstack:/products:/debian/xUbuntu_16.04/ /
----
+
. Edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file:
+
----
sudo visudo
----
+
Grant [command]``sudo`` access to the user by adding this line to the [filename]``sudoers`` file. Replace [systemitem]``<user>`` with the name of the user that will bootstrap the client in the {webui}:
+
----
<user>   ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3

.Procedure: Synchronizing {ubuntu} Repositories


. In the {susemgr} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Repositories] and click btn:[Create Repository].
. In the [guimenu]``Create Repository`` dialog, use these values to create a new repository:
+
* In the [guimenu]``Repository URL`` field, type the URL that contains the appropriate binary files, for example [path]``http://ubuntumirror.example.com/ubuntu/dists/bionic/main/binary-amd64/``.
* In the [guimenu]``Repository Type`` field, select [systemitem]``deb``.
+
. Click btn:[Create Repository] to create the repository.
. Navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels] and click btn:[Create Channel].
. In the [guimenu]``Create Software Channel`` dialog, create the channel as required for your environment.
Ensure that in the [guimenu]``Architecture`` field, you select [systemitem]``AMD64 Debian``.
. Click btn:[Create Channel] to create the software channel.
. Navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels] and select your new channel from the channel list.
. In the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, click the [guimenu]``Add/Remove`` tab, and select your new repository from the repository list.
. Click the btn:[Update Repositories] button to synchronize the repository.


You can check the progress of your synchronization from the command line using this command:

tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync.log /var/log/rhn/reposync/*
