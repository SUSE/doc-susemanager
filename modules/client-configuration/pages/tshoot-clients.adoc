== Bare Metal Systems

If a bare metal system on the network is not automatically added to the [guilabel]``Systems`` list, check these things first:

* You must have the [path]``pxe-default-image`` package installed.
* File paths and parameters must be configured correctly. Check that the [path]``vmlinuz0`` and [path]``initrd0.img`` files, which are provided by [path]``pxe-default-image``, are in the locations specified in the [path]``rhn.conf`` configuration file.
* Ensure the networking equipment connecting the bare metal system to the {productname} server is working correctly, and that you can reach the {productname} server IP address from the server.
* The bare metal system to be provisioned must have PXE booting enabled in the boot sequence, and must not be attempting to boot an operating system.
* The DHCP server must be responding to DHCP requests during boot. Check the PXE boot messages to ensure that:
** the DHCP server is assigning the expected IP address
** the DHCP server is assigning the the {productname} server IP address as [option]``next-server`` for booting.
* Ensure Cobbler is running, and that the Discovery feature is enabled.

If you see a blue Cobbler menu shortly after booting, discovery has started.
If it does not complete successfully, temporarily disable automatic shutdown in order to help diagnose the problem. To disable automatic shutdown:

. Select [option]``pxe-default-profile`` in the Cobbler menu with the arrow keys, and press the Tab key before the timer expires.
. Add the kernel boot parameter [option]``spacewalk-finally=running`` using the integrated editor, and press Enter to continue booting.
. Enter a shell with the username [option]``root`` and password [option]``linux`` to continue debugging.

[IMPORTANT]
.Duplicate profiles
====
Due to a technical limitation, it is not possible to reliably distinguish a new bare metal system from a system that has previously been discovered.
Therefore, we recommended that you do not power on bare metal systems multiple times, as this will result in duplicate profiles.

== Cloned Salt Clients

If you have used your hypervisor clone utility, and attempted to register the cloned Salt client, you might get this error:

----
We're sorry, but the system could not be found.
----

This is caused by the new, cloned, system having the same machine ID as an existing, registered, system.
You can adjust this manually to correct the error and register the cloned system successfully.


For more information and instructions, see xref:administration:tshoot-registerclones.adoc[].



== Mounting /tmp with noexec

Salt runs remote commands from [filename]``/tmp`` on the client's filesystem.
Therefore you must not mount [filename]``/tmp`` with the [option]``noexec`` option.



== SSL errors

On SLES{nbsp}11 systems, clients can sometimes have SSL errors which make some operations unusable, including package management and bootstrapping.
In this case, you will see an error like this:

----
Repository 'SLES11-SP4-SUSE-Manager-Tools x86_64' is invalid.
[|] Valid metadata not found at specified URL(s)
Please check if the URIs defined for this repository are pointing to a valid repository.
Skipping repository 'SLES11-SP4-SUSE-Manager-Tools x86_64' because of the above error.
Download (curl) error for 'www.example.com':
Error code: Unrecognized error
Error message: error:1409442E:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:tlsv1 alert protocol version
----

This occurs because Apache requires TLS{nbsp}v1.2, but older versions of SLES do not support this version of the TLS protocol.
To fix this error, you need to force Apache to accept a greater range of protocol versions.
Open the [path]``/etc/apache2/ssl-global.conf`` configuration file, locate the [systemitem]``SSLProtocol`` line, and update it to read:

----
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
----

This will need to be done manually on the server, and with a Salt state on the Proxy.
Restart the [systemitem]``apache`` service on each system after making the changes.



== Disabling the FQDNS grain

FQDNS grain returns the list of all the FQDN of the system. Ideally it should be pretty fast to collect this list but if the DNS settings on the system has some problem or misconfigured for some reason then this grain's
calculation could get pretty expensive and as during name resolution Python's GIL is acquired so the salt-minion process could completely get stuck.

To guard from this problem, a new flag in salt has been introduced which will disable this grain. Additionally salt network module has been extended to have fqdns function instead which returns the same result as FQDNS grain
but without the problem described above.


Newly registered Salt clients will have the FQDNS grain disabled by default.

Disable the FQDNS grain on the existing registered salt clients by running this command on the server:
----
salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_disable_fqdns_grain
----

This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server.
If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load.
To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command:
----
salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_disable_fqdns_grain
----

You will need to wait for this command to finish executing.
Do not end the process with kbd:[Ctrl+C].
