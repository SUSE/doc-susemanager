[[vhm-caasp]]
= VHM and SUSE CaaS Platform

You can use a {productname} VHM to gather instances from {caasp}.

The VHM allows {productname} to obtain and report information about your virtual machines.
For more information on VHMs, see xref:client-configuration:vhm.adoc[].



== Register CaaSP nodes

You can register each {caasp} node to {productname} using the same method as you would a Salt client.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].

We recommend that you create an activation key to associate {caasp} channels, and to onboard the associated nodes.
For more on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].

If you are using ``cloud-init``, we recommended that you use a bootstrap script in the ``cloud-init`` configuration.
For more on bootstrapping, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].


When you have added the {caasp} nodes to {productname}, you will be able to:

* View the patch level status of each node
* Perform configuration management operations against the nodes, including using Salt states.
* Assign different set of channels to clusters using channel staging and lifecycle management filters.

Additionally, updates related to {k8s} are automatically installed, because of a self-updating daemon running on the {caasp} nodes.

Waiting on clarification of this. LKB 2019-11-11
[WARNING]
====
Do not use {productname} to perform these actions on any {caasp} nodes:

* Install, upgrade, or removal of ``kubernetes-kubeadm``, ``kubernetes-kubelet``, ``kubernetes-client``, ``cri-o``, or ``cni-plugins``.
* Scheduling and executing a node reboot

These actions are not supported.
