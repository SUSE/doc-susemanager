= VHM and SUSE Container as a Service Platform

You can use a {productname} VHM to gather instances from SUSEÂ Container-as-a-Service Platform ({caasp}).

The VHM allows {productname} to obtain and report information about your virtual machines.
For more information on VHMs, see xref:client-configuration:vhm.adoc[].

= Registering the Container as a Service Platform nodes to {productname}

You can register each node of the Container as a Service Platform to {productname} using the usual way of registering a Salt minion client.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[]

It is recommended to create an activation key (see xref:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[]) to associate Container as a Service Platform channels and use the activation key when onboarding the associated nodes.
If you are using cloud-init, it is also recommended to use the bootstrap script in the cloud-init configuration.

By registering the Container as a Service Platform nodes to {productname}:

- You can see the patch level status of the CaaS Platform nodes
- You can perform configuration management operations against the nodes using SUSE Manager. For example: Salt states.
- You can assign different set of channels (with channel staging and/or CLM filters) to different clusters. The self-updating daemon already running on Container as a Service Platform nodes will automatically install any update related to Kubernetes. For more information on the self-updating daemon, see the Container as a Service Platform documentation.

[WARNING]
====
The following actions must NOT be executed fom {productname} on any of the Container as a Platform nodes:

* Package installation, upgrade, removal and patch installation related to the following packages: `kubernetes-kubeadm kubernetes-kubelet kubernetes-client cri-o cni-plugins`
* Scheduling and executing a reboot of a node
