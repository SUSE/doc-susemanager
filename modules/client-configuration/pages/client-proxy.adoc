= Registering Clients on a Proxy






Within the {webui}, standard proxy pages will show information about client, no matter whether minions or traditional clients.

A list of clients connected to a proxy can be seen by clicking on the name of the Proxy in menu:Main Navigation[Systems > Systems > Proxy], selecting the [guimenu]``Details`` tab, and then selecting the [guimenu]``Proxy`` tab.

A list of chained proxies for a minion can be seen by clicking on the name of the minion in menu:Main Navigation[Systems > All], selecting the [guimenu]``Details`` tab, and then selecting the [guimenu]``Connection`` tab.

If you decide to move any of your clients between proxies or the server you will need to repeat the registration process from scratch.
