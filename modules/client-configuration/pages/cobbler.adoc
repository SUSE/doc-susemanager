[[cobbler]]
= Cobbler

Cobbler is an installation server that allows you to perform unattended system installations.
It can be used on server, client, or guest systems, and in virtual environments.

This section explains the Cobbler features most commonly used with {productname}:

* Installation environment analysis using the [command]``cobbler check`` command
* Multi-site installation server configuration using the [command]``cobbler replicate`` command
* Virtual machine guest installation automation with the [command]``koan`` client-side tool
* Building installation ISOs with PXE-like menus using the [command]``cobbler buildiso`` command (for {productname} systems with x86_64 architecture)

For more detailed Cobbler documentation, see http://cobbler.github.io/manuals/.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} only supports Cobbler functions that are available in the {productname} {webui}, or through the {productname} API.
All features documented here are supported.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Cobbler is not currently supported within {smr} environments.
If you intend to use your installation with {smr} formulas, do not configure Cobbler.

=== Background Information about the Synchronization Process

// Taken from https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1141603
// To be edited!!!

A sync is basically a rebuild of every file cobbler touched. I will try give you an impression with an numbered list.

1. Run Pre-Sync-Triggers (this can be any number of shell scripts to my knowledge)
2. Delete all files and directories which are not allowed in /var/www/cobbler
3. Create all needed folders
4. Delete all elements inside the folders.
5. Generate the tftpd directory
6. Write the DHCP files (if management is enabled)
7. Do the same with DNS
8. Clean the Cache
9. If rsync management is enabled do that
10. Run Post-Sync-Triggers (this can also be any number of shell scripts to my knowledge)

== Cobbler Requirements

To use Cobbler for system installation with PXE, you will require a TFTP server.
{productname} installs a TFTP server by default.
To PXE boot systems, you will require a DHCP server, or have access to a network DHCP server.
Edit the [path]``/etc/dhcp.conf`` configuration file to change [option]``next-server`` to the hostname or IP address of your Cobbler server.

Cobbler requires an open HTTP port to synchronize data between the Server and the Proxy.
By default, Cobbler uses port 80, but you can configure it to use port 443 instead if that suits your environment.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Cobbler uses host names as a unique key for each system.
If you are using the [option]``pxe-default-image`` to onboard bare metal systems, make sure every system has a unique host name.
Non-unique host names will cause all systems with the same host name to have the configuration files overwritten when a provisioning profile is assigned.
====



== Configure Cobbler

Cobbler configuration is primarily managed using the [path]``/etc/cobbler/settings`` file.
Cobbler will run with the default settings unchanged.
All configurable settings are explained in detail in the [path]``/etc/cobbler/settings`` file, including information on each setting, and recommendations.

// Removed tshooting language not found error, only applies to sles 12 & SUMA 2.1/3: https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7018334 LKB 2018-08-02


Cobbler uses DHCP to automate bare metal installations from a PXE boot server.
You must have administrative access to the network's DHCP server, or be able to configure DHCP directly on the the Cobbler server.

If you have an existing DHCP server, you will need to edit the DHCP configuration file so that it points to the Cobbler server and PXE boot image.

.Procedure: Configuring DHCP for Cobbler
. On the DHCP server, as root, open the [path]``/etc/dhcpd.conf`` file.
. Append a new class with options for performing PXE boot installation.
For example:
+
----
allow booting;
allow bootp;
class "PXE"
{match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 9) = "PXEClient";
next-server 192.168.2.1;
filename "pxelinux.0";}
----
+
This example:

* Enables the [systemitem]``bootp`` protocol for network booting.
* Creates a class called ``PXE``.
* Identifies systems as ``PXEClient`` if they are configured with PXE as the first boot priority.
* Directs PXEClients to the Cobbler server at ``192.168.2.1``.
* Retrieves the [path]``pxelinux.0``bootloader file.
+
. Save the file.



.Procedure: Configuring PXE Boot in KVM
While it is possible to use KVM with PXE booting, it can be unreliable.
We do not recommend you use this on production systems.

. Use the [command]``virsh`` command to produce a dump of the current network XML description:
+
----
virsh net-dumpxml --inactive network > network.xml
----

. Open the XML dump file at [path]``network.xml`` and add a [systemitem]``bootp`` parameter within the [systemitem]``<dhcp>``` element:
+
----
<bootp file='/pxelinux.0' server='192.168.100.153'/>
----

. Use the [command]``virsh`` command to install the updated description:
+
----
virsh net-define network.xml
----
+
Alternatively, you can use the [command]``net-edit`` subcommand, which will also perform some error checking.

.Example: Minimal Network XML Description for KVM
----
<network>
  <name>default</name>
  <uuid>1da84185-31b5-4c8b-9ee2-a7f5ba39a7ee</uuid>
  <forward mode='nat'>
    <nat>
      <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
    </nat>
  </forward>
  <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:29:59:18'/>
  <domain name='default'/>
  <ip address='192.168.100.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.100.128' end='192.168.100.254'/>
      <bootp file='/pxelinux.0' server='192.168.100.153'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
----



== TFTP

{productname} uses the [daemon]``tftp`` daemon.
The [daemon]``tftp`` daemon is the recommended method for PXE services, and is installed by default.
The default configuration works in most cases.
However, if you need to change the configuration, use the {yast} Services Manager.

The TFTP service must be running so it can serve the [path]``pxelinux.0`` boot image.
Start {yast} and use menu:System[Services Manager] to configure the [daemon]``tftp`` daemon.

You can also synchronize Cobbler-generated TFTP contents to a {productname} Proxy.

.Procedure: Installing TFTP

. On the {productname} Server, as root, install the [systemitem]``susemanager-tftpsync`` package:
+
----
zypper install susemanager-tftpsync
----
. On the {productname} Proxy, as root user, install the [systemitem]``susemanager-tftpsync-recv`` package:
+
----
zypper install susemanager-tftpsync-recv
----

.Procedure: Configuring TFTP on a Proxy

. On the {productname} Proxy, as root, run the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` script.
. The script will interactively ask you for details on the host names and IP addresses of the {productname} Server and Proxy, as well for the location of the [path]``tftpboot`` directory on the Proxy.

For more information, use the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh --help`` command.


.Procedure: Configuring TFTP on a Server

. On the {productname} Server, as root, run the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` script.
+
----
configure-tftpsync.sh proxy1.example.com proxy2.example.com
----
. Run the [command]``cobbler sync`` command to push the files to the proxy.
This will fail if you have not configured the proxies correctly.
. If you want to change the list of proxies later on, you can use the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` script to edit them.


[NOTE]
====
If you reinstall an already configured proxy and want to push all the files again, you must remove the cache file at [path]``/var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json`` before you call [command]``cobbler sync``.
====


== Synchronize and Start the Cobbler Service

The {productname} Server must be able to access the {productname} Proxy systems directly.
You cannot push using a proxy.

[WARNING]
====
Do not start or stop the [command]``cobblerd`` service independent of the {productname} service.
Doing so can cause errors.
Always use [command]``/usr/sbin/spacewalk-service`` to start or stop {productname}.
====

Check that all the prerequisites the Cobbler service requires, are configured according to your requirements.
You can do this by running the [command]``cobbler check`` command.

// Does this work and makes sense?
When you had to change the configuration, restart the {productname} service:

----
/usr/sbin/spacewalk-service restart
----

[[advanced.topics.cobbler.adddistro]]
== Adding a Distribution to Cobbler


If all Cobbler prerequisites have been met and Cobbler is running, you can use the Cobbler server as an installation source for a distribution:

Make installation files such as the kernel image and the initrd image available on the Cobbler server.
Then add a distribution to Cobbler, using either the Web interface or the command line tools.

For information about creating and configuring {ay} or Kickstart distributions from the {productname} interface, refer to pass:c[xref:FILENAME.adoc#ref.webui.systems.autoinst.distribution[]].

To create a distribution from the command line, use the [command]``cobbler`` command as root:

----
cobbler distro add --name=`string`--kernel=`path`--initrd=`path`
----


[option]``--name=``[replaceable]``string`` option::
A label used to differentiate one distribution choice from another (for example, ``sles12server``).

[option]``--kernel=``[replaceable]``path`` option::
Specifies the path to the kernel image file.

[option]``--initrd=``[replaceable]``path`` option::
specifies the path to the initial ram disk (initrd) image file.

[[advanced.topics.cobbler.addprofile]]
== Adding a Profile to Cobbler

Once you have added a distribution to Cobbler, you can add profiles.

Cobbler profiles associate a distribution with additional options like {ay} or Kickstart files.
Profiles are the core unit of provisioning and there must be at least one Cobbler profile for every distribution added.
For example, two profiles might be created for a Web server and a desktop configuration.
While both profiles use the same distribution, the profiles are for different installation types.

For information about creating and configuring Kickstart and {ay} profiles in the {productname} interface, refer to pass:c[xref:FILENAME.adoc#ref.webui.systems.autoinst.profiles[]].

Use the [command]``cobbler`` command as root to create profiles from the command line:

----
cobbler profile add --name=string --distro=string [--autoinstall=url] \
  [--virt-file-size=gigabytes] [--virt-ram=megabytes]
----

[option]``--name=``[replaceable]``string``::
A unique label for the profile, such as `sles12webserver` or ``sles12workstation``.

[option]``--distro=``[replaceable]``string``::
The distribution that will be used for this profile.
For adding distributions, see pass:c[xref:FILENAME.adoc#advanced.topics.cobbler.adddistro[]].

[option]``--autoinstall=``[replaceable]``url``::
The location of the Kickstart file (if available).

[option]``--virt-file-size=``[replaceable]``gigabytes``::
The size of the virtual guest file image (in gigabytes).
The default is 5{nbsp}GB.

[option]``--virt-ram=``[replaceable]``megabytes``::
The maximum amount of physical RAM a virtual guest can consume (in megabytes).
The default is 512{nbsp}MB.

[[advanced.topics.cobbler.addsystem]]
== Adding a System to Cobbler

Once the distributions and profiles for Cobbler have been created, add systems to Cobbler.
System records map a piece of hardware on a client with the Cobbler profile assigned to run on it.

[NOTE]
====
If you are provisioning using [command]``koan`` and PXE menus alone, it is not required to create system records.
They are useful when system-specific Kickstart templating is required or to establish that a specific system should always get specific content installed.
If a client is intended for a certain role, system records should be created for it.
====

For information about creating and configuring automated installation from the {productname} interface, refer to pass:c[xref:FILENAME.adoc#s4-sm-system-details-kick[]].

Run this command as the root user to add a system to the Cobbler configuration:

----
cobbler system add --name=string --profile=string \
  --mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
----


[option]``--name=``[replaceable]``string``::
 A unique label for the system, such as `engineering_server` or ``frontoffice_workstation``.

[option]``--profile=``[replaceable]``string``::
Specifies the name of one of the profiles added in pass:c[xref:FILENAME.adoc#advanced.topics.cobbler.addprofile[]].

[option]``--mac-address=``[replaceable]``AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF``::
Allows systems with the specified MAC address to automatically be provisioned to the profile associated with the system record when they are being installed.

For more options, such as setting hostname or IP addresses, refer to the Cobbler manpage ([command]``man cobbler``).

////

== Kickstart Templates

Kickstart files are used to automate {rhel} client installations.
Kickstart templates are used to describe how to create Kickstart files.
To help with creating Kickstart templates, you can create Kickstart variables within the {productname} {webui}.
This allows you to create and manage large numbers of profiles and systems, without having to manually create Kickstart files for each.

Kickstart templates are shared by various profiles and systems that can each have their own variables and values.
These variables modify the templates, and a template engine parses the template and variables into a usable Kickstart file.

Cobbler uses a template engine called Cheetah that provides support for templates, variables, and snippets.

For more information on creating Kickstart profile variables, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-distributions.adoc[].


=== Kickstart Template Syntax

Kickstart templates can have static values for certain common items such as PXE image file names, subnet addresses, and common paths such as [path]``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/``.
However, templates differ from standard Kickstart files in their use of variables.

For example, a standard Kickstart file might have a networking section like this:

----
network --device=eth0 --bootproto=static --ip=192.168.100.24 \
  --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=192.168.100.1 --nameserver=192.168.100.2
----

In a Kickstart template file, the networking section would look like this instead:

----
network --device=$net_dev --bootproto=static --ip=$ip_addr \
  --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=$my_gateway --nameserver=$my_nameserver
----

These variables are substituted with the values set in your Kickstart profile variables or in your system detail variables.
If the same variable is defined in both the profile and the system detail, then the system detail variable takes precedence.


Kickstart templates use syntax rules that rely on punctuation symbols.
To avoid clashes, they need to be properly treated.

If the template contains shell script variables like ``$(example)``, the content needs to be escaped with a backslash: ``\$(example)``.
If the variable is defined in the template, the templating engine will evaluate it correctly.
If there is no such variable, the content will be left unchanged.
Escaping the kbd:[$] symbol will prevent the templating engine from evaluating the symbol as an internal variable.

Long scripts or strings can be escaped by wrapping them with the `\#raw` and `\#end raw` directives.
For example:

----
#raw
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0..2}; do
 echo "$i - Hello World!"
done
#end raw
----

Any line with a kbd:[#] symbol followed by a whitespace is treated as a comment and is therefore not evaluated.
For example:

----
#start some section (this is a comment)
echo "Hello, world"
#end some section (this is a comment)
----

For more information about Kickstart templates and Cobbler, see
https://cobbler.github.io/manuals/2.8.0/3/5_-_Kickstart_Templating.html.




=== Kickstart Snippets

Kickstart snippets are sections of Kickstart code that can be called by a [option]``$SNIPPET()`` function.
The snippet is parsed by Cobbler and substituted with the contents of the snippet.

This example sets up a snippet for a common hard drive partition configuration:

----
clearpart --all
part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary
part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary
part swap --recommended

part pv.00 --size=1 --grow

volgroup vg00 pv.00
logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000
----

Save this snippet of the configuration to a file in [path]``/var/lib/cobbler/snippets/``, where Cobbler can access it.

Use the snippet by calling the [option]``$SNIPPET()`` function in your Kickstart templates.
For example:

----
$SNIPPET('my_partition')
----

Cobbler will parse the function with the snippet of code contained in the [path]``my_partition`` file.

[[advanced.topics.cobbler.koan]]
== Using Koan

Whether you are provisioning guests on a virtual machine or reinstalling a new distribution on a running system, Koan works in conjunction with Cobbler to provision systems.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.koan.virt]]
=== Using Koan to Provision Virtual Systems

If you have created a virtual machine profile as documented in pass:c[xref:FILENAME.adoc#advanced.topics.cobbler.addprofile[]], you can use [command]``koan`` to initiate the installation of a virtual guest on a system.
For example, create a Cobbler profile with the following command:

----
cobbler add profile --name=virtualfileserver \
  --distro=sles12-x86_64-server --virt-file-size=20 --virt-ram=1000
----

This profile is for a fileserver running {sls}{nbsp}12 with a 20{nbsp}GB guest image size and allocated 1{nbsp}GB of system RAM.
To find the name of the virtual guest system profile, use the [command]``koan`` command:

----
koan --server=hostname --list-profiles
----

This command lists all the available profiles created with [command]``cobbler profile add``.

Create the image file, and begin installation of the virtual guest system:

----
koan --virt --server=cobbler-server.example.com \
  --profile=virtualfileserver --virtname=marketingfileserver
----

This command specifies that a virtual guest system be created from the Cobbler server (hostname [server]``cobbler-server.example.com``) using the `virtualfileserver` profile.
The [option]``virtname`` option specifies a label for the virtual guest, which by default is the system's MAC address.

Once the installation of the virtual guest is complete, it can be used as any other virtual guest system.



[[advanced.topics.cobbler.koan.reinstall]]
=== Using Koan to Reinstall Running Systems

[command]``koan`` can replace a still running system with a new installation from the available Cobbler profiles by executing the following command __on the system to be reinstalled__:

----
koan --replace-self --server=hostname --profile=name
----

This command, running on the system to be replaced, will start the provisioning process and replace the system with the profile in [option]``--profile=name`` on the Cobbler server specified in [option]``--server=hostname``.

////


== Build ISOs with Cobbler

Cobbler can create ISO boot images that contain a set of distributions, kernels, and a menu, that work similar to a PXE installation.

[NOTE]
====
Building ISOs with Cobbler is not supported on {ibmz}.
====

The Cobbler [command]``buildiso`` command takes parameters to define the name and output location of the boot ISO.
For example:

----
cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso
----

The boot ISO includes all profiles and systems by default.
You can limit which profiles and systems are used, with the [option]``--profiles`` and [option]``--systems`` options.
For example:

----
cobbler buildiso --systems="system1,system2,system3" \
  --profiles="profile1,profile2,profile3"
----

[NOTE]
====
If you cannot write an ISO image to a public [path]``tmp`` directory, check your systemd settings in [path]``/usr/lib/systemd/system/cobblerd.service``.
====




== Bare Metal Provisioning

Systems that have not yet been provisioned are called bare metal systems.
You can provision bare metal systems using Cobbler.
Once a bare metal system has been provisioned in this way, it will appear in the [guilabel]``Systems`` list, where you can perform regular provisioning with autoinstallation, for a completely unattended installation.

To successfully provision a bare metal system, you will require a fully patched {productname} server.

The system to be provisioned must have x86_64 architecture, with at least 2&#160;GB RAM, and be capable of PXE booting.

The server uses TFTP to provision the bare metal client, so the appropriate port and networks must be configured correctly in order for provisioning to be successful.
In particular, ensure that you have a DHCP server, and have set the [option]``next-server`` parameter to the {productname} server IP address or hostname.


=== Enable Bare Metal Systems Management

Bare metal systems management can be enabled or disabled in the {productname} {webui} by navigating to menu:Admin[SUSE Manager Configuration > Bare-metal systems].

[NOTE]
====
New systems are added to the organization of the administrator who enabled the bare metal systems management feature.
To change the organization, log in as an Administrator of the required organization, and re-enable the feature.
====

When the feature has been enabled, any bare metal system connected to the server network will be automatically added to the organization when it is powered on.
The process can take a few minutes, and the system will automatically shut down once it is complete.
After the reboot, the system will appear in the [guilabel]``Systems`` list.
Click on the name of the system to see basic information, or go to the [guilabel]``Properties``, [guilabel]``Notes``, and [guilabel]``Hardware`` tabs for more details.
You can migrate bare metal systems to other organizations if required, using the [guilabel]``Migrate`` tab.


=== Provision Bare Metal Systems

Provisioning bare metal systems is similar to provisioning other systems, and can be done using the [guilabel]``Provisioning`` tab.
However, you will not be able to schedule provisioning, it will happen automatically as soon as the system is configured and powered on.

[NOTE]
====
System Set Manager can be used with bare metal systems.
However, not all SSM features are available, because bare metal systems do not have an operating system installed.
This also applies to mixed sets that contain bare metal systems.
All features will be re-enabled if the bare metal systems are removed from the set.
====
