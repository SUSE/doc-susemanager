= Creating the {productname} Tools Repository




//TODO This document is only relevant for SUSE Manager, we should probably add an <ifdef> for productname?

In this section you will create a tools repository on the {productname} Server for providing client tools.
The client tools repository contains packages for installing Salt on clients as well as required packages for registering traditional clients during the bootstrapping procedure.
These packages will be installed from the newly generated repository during the registration process.
In the following procedure you will create the {sle} tools repository.

[IMPORTANT]
.Creating a Tools Repository when an SCC Channel has not been Synced
====
Before following the procedure to create the tools repository make sure the {suse} vendor channel you will be using with your client has been completely synced.
You can check this by running [command]``tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/``<CHANNEL_NAME>``.log`` as _root_.
In the following example replace [replaceable]``version`` with the actual version string:

----
# tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/sles`version`-pool-x86_64.log
----

Once completed you should see the following output in your terminal:

----
2017/12/12 15:20:32 +02:00 Importing packages started.
2017/12/12 15:22:02 +02:00 1.07 %

2017/12/12 15:35:49 +02:00 Importing packages finished.

.Procedure: Generating the Tools Repository for {sle}
. Open a terminal on the server as root and enter the following command to list available bootstrap repositories:
+

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l SLE-`version`-x86_64
----
. Then invoke the same command using the listed repository as the product label to actually create the bootstrap repository:
+

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-`version`-x86_64
----
. {productname} will create and add the client tools to the newly created [path]``repositories`` directory located at [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/``.

This repository is suitable for both Server and Desktop of {sle}.

[NOTE]
.Support for {sle} 15 Products
====
If you have mirrored more than one {sle} 15 Product (for example, {slsa} and {slsa} for SAP Application), you can specify the one you are actually interested in. First check what is avaiable:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 --with-custom-channel
Multiple options for parent channel found. Please use option
--with-parent-channel <label> and choose one of:
- sle-product-sles15-pool-x86_64
- sle-product-sles_sap15-pool-x86_64
- sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64
----

Then specify it with [literal]``--with-parent-channel``:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 --with-parent-channel sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64
----
