= Client Registration Overview

There are two ways to register clients to your {productname} Server.
Both methods are described in this manual:

* For Salt clients, the simplest method is to register your clients using the {productname} {webui}.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-webui.adoc[].
* If you need to have more control over the process, want to register many clients, or are registering traditional clients, we recommend creating a bootstrap script.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:bootstrap.adoc[].

You must create an activation key first, to use one of these methods.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].
