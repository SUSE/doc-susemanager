= Registering with the Web UI on a Proxy

Registering Salt clients to a {productname} Proxy using the {webui} is similar to registering clients directly with the {productname} Server.


.Procedure: Registering clients to a proxy in the {webui}

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, type the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client to be bootstrapped.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, type the SSH port number that will be used to connect and bootstrap the client.
By default, the SSH  port is [systemitem]``22``.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, type the username to log in to the client.
By default, the username is [systemitem]``root``.
. In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, type password to log in to the client.
. In the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` field, select the activation key that is associated with the software channel you want to use to bootstrap the client.
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy`` field, select the proxy server you want to register to.
. By default, the [guimenu]``Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking`` checkbox is selected.
This allows the bootstrap process to automatically accept SSH host keys without requiring you to manually authenticate.
. OPTIONAL: Check the [guimenu]``Manage System Completely via SSH`` checkbox.
If you check this option, the client will be configured to use SSH for its connection to the Server, and no other connection method will be configured.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap] to begin registration.
When the bootstrap process has completed, your client will be listed at menu:Systems[System List].

Instead of the {webui}, you may use the command line to register a client through a proxy.
This procedure requires that you have installed the Salt package on the client before registration, and have the Advanced systems module activated.

.Procedure: Register a Salt client through a proxy from the command line

. Add the proxy FQDN as the master in the clients configuration file located at:
+
----
/etc/salt/minion
----
+
or alternatively:
+
----
/etc/salt/minion.d/NAME.conf
----
. Add the FQDN to the minion file:
+
----
master: proxy123.example.com
----
+
Save and restart the salt-minion service with:
+
----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----
. On the Server, accept the new client key with:
+
----
salt-key -a 'client'
----
+
The client will now connect to the proxy exclusively for Salt operations and normal HTTP package downloads.
