= Registering Salt Clients




There are three possible methods for registering Salt minions.
You can use a bootstrap repository, a bootstrap script, or install using the {webui}.

This section describes using a bootstrap repository.
Registering Salt clients with a bootstrap client is the same as registering traditional clients, which is described at xref:quickstart3_chap_suma_keys_and_first_client.adoc#registering.clients.traditional[Registering Traditional Clients]. When using this method, ensure you enable the [guimenu]``Bootstrap using Salt`` and activation key options in [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment``, so that highstate is applied automatically.
For information on using the {webui}, see xref:reference-webui-systems.adoc#ref.webui.systems.bootstrapping[Bootstrapping Salt].

You can also use these methods to change existing traditional clients into Salt minions.

[IMPORTANT]
.GPG Keys and Uyuni Client Tools
====
The GPG key used by Uyuni Client Tools is not trusted by default.
Either update your bootstrap repository to trust the key explicitly, or use the {webui} to manually trust the key from each client.
====


To register Salt clients with a bootstrap repository, you will need to have already set up a {susemgr} tools repository, which is described in xref:quickstart3_chap_suma_keys_and_first_client.adoc#create.tools.repository[Create Tools Repository].
You will also need to have fully synchronized a base channel for clients to obtain software packages (for example: `SLES12-SP4-Pool_for_x86_64`).


.Procedure: Registering Salt Minions
. On your minion as {rootuser} enter the following command:
+

----
zypper ar http://FQDN.server.example.com/pub/repositories/sle/12/4/bootstrap/ \
   sles12-sp4
----
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not use ``HTTPS``.
Use `HTTP` instead to avoid errors.
====
+

. After adding the repository containing the necessary Salt packages execute:
+

----
zypper in salt-minion
----
. Modify the minion configuration file to point to the fully qualified domain name ([replaceable]``FQDN``) of the {productname} server (master):
+

----
vi /etc/salt/minion
----
+
Find and change the line:
+

----
master: salt
----
+
to:
+

----
master: FQDN.server.example.com
----
. Restart the Salt minion with:
+

----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----

Your newly registered minion should now show up within the {webui} under menu:Salt[Keys].
Accept the [guimenu]``pending`` key to begin management.
