= Registering {rhel} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {rhel} operating systems.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{rhel} clients are based on {redhat} and are unrelated to {sleses}, RES, {redhat}, or {slesa}.
You are responsible for arranging access to {redhat} base media repositories and {rhela} installation media, as well as connecting {productname} Server to the {redhat} content delivery network.
You must obtain support from {redhat} for all your {rhela} systems.
If you do not do this, you might be violating your terms with {redhat}.
====



== Server Requirements

Before you begin, check that your {productname} Server meets the requirements at xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

Taskomatic uses one CPU core, and requires at least 3072{nbsp}MB of RAM.
To ensure that taskomatic has access to enough memory, open the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, and add this line:

----
taskomatic.java.maxmemory=3072
----

Restart Taskomatic:
----
systemctl restart taskomatic
----

== Import Entitlements and CA Certificate

{redhat} clients require a {redhat} certificate authority (CA) and entitlement certificate.

Entitlement certificates are embedded with expiration dates, which match the length of the support subscription.
To avoid disruption, you will need to repeat this process at the end of every support subscription period.

{redhat} supply a subscription manager tool to manage subscription assignments.
It runs locally to track installed products and subscriptions.
Clients must be registered with the subscription manager to obtain certificates.



.Procedure: Registering Clients to Subscription Manager

. On the client system, at the command prompt, register with the subscription manager tool:
+
----
subscription-manager register
----
+
Enter your {redhat} Portal username and password when prompted.
. Copy your entitlement certificate and key from the client system, to a location that the {productname} Server can access:
+
----
cp /etc/pki/entitlement/ /<example>/entitlement/
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Your entitlement certificate and key will both have a file extension of [path]``.pem``.
The key will also have [path]``key`` in the filename.
====
+
. Copy the {redhat} CA Certificate file from the client system, to the same web location as the entitlement certificate and key:
+
----
cp /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem /example/entitlement
----


To manage repositories on your {redhat} client, you need to import the CA and entitlement certificates to the {productname} Server.
This requires three entries: one each for the entitlement certificate, the entitlement key, and the {redhat} certificate.



.Procedure: Importing Certificates to the Server

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > GPG and SSL Keys].
+
// Maybe we  should add a screenshot, as we have at the current guide: https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all/html/SBP-sumaforrhel/index.html#sec-import
// Not necessary, it's pretty simple to navigate to a page. LKB

. Click btn:[Create Stored Key/Cert] and set these parameters for the entitlement certificate:
* In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, type [systemitem]``Entitlement-Cert-date``.
* In the [guimenu]``Type`` field, select [systemitem]``SSL``.
* In the [guimenu]``Select file to upload`` field, browse to the location where you saved the entitlement certificate, and select the [path]``.pem`` certificate file.
. Click btn:[Create Key].
. Click btn:[Create Stored Key/Cert] and set these parameters for the entitlement key:
* In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, type [systemitem]``Entitlement-key-date``.
* In the [guimenu]``Type`` field, select [systemitem]``SSL``.
* In the [guimenu]``Select file to upload`` field, browse to the location where you saved the entitlement key, and select the [path]``.pem`` key file.
. Click btn:[Create Key].
. Click btn:[Create Stored Key/Cert] and set these parameters for the {redhat} certificate:
* In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, type [systemitem]``redhat-uep``.
* In the [guimenu]``Type`` field, select [systemitem]``SSL``.
* In the [guimenu]``Select file to upload`` field, browse to the location where you saved the {redhat} certificate, and select the certificate file.
. Click btn:[Create Key].

// put the screenshot here as a result. LKB



== Repository Management


You can use the subscription manager tool to get the URLs of the repositories you want to mirror:

----
subscription-manager repos
----

You can use these repository URLs to create custom repositories.
This allows you to mirror only the content you need to manage your clients.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only create custom versions of {redhat} repositories if you have the correct entitlements in your {redhat} Portal.
====



.Procedure: Creating Custom Repositories

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Repositories].
. Click btn:[Create Repository] and set these parameters for the entitlement certificate:
* In the [guimenu]``Repository Label`` field, type [systemitem]``rhel-7-server-rpms``.
* In the [guimenu]``Repository URL`` field, type the URL of the repository to mirror.
For example, [systemitem]``https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/rhel/server/7/7Server/x86_64/os/``.
* In the [guimenu]``Has Signed Metadata?`` field, uncheck all Red Hat Enterprise Repositories.
* In the [guimenu]``SSL CA Certificate`` field, select [systemitem]``redhat-uep``.
* In the [guimenu]``SSL Client Certificate`` field, select [systemitem]``Entitlement-Cert-date``.
* In the [guimenu]``SSL Client Key`` field, select [systemitem]``Entitlement-Key-date``.
* Leave all other fields as the default values.
. Click btn:[Create Repository].
. Repeat for every repository you want to define.


When you have created the custom repositories, you can create corresponding custom channels.



.Procedure: Creating Custom Channels

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels].
. Click btn:[Create Channel] and set these parameters for the entitlement certificate.
Ensure you use the correct {rhela} version:
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Name`` field, type [systemitem]``RHEL 7 x86_64``.
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Label`` field, type [systemitem]``rhel7-x86_64-server``.
* In the [guimenu]``Parent Channel`` field, select [systemitem]``None``.
* In the [guimenu]``Architecture`` field, select [systemitem]``x86_64``.
* In the [guimenu]``Repository Checksum Type`` field, select [systemitem]``sha1``.
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Summary`` field, type [systemitem]``RHEL 7 x86_64``.
* In the [guimenu]``Organization Sharing`` field, select [systemitem]``Public``.
. Click btn:[Create Channel].
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, check the appropriate repository, and click btn:[Update repositories].
. OPTIONAL: Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` tab to set a recurring schedule for synchronization of this repository.
. Click btn:[Sync Now] to begin synchronization immediately.


[NOTE]
====
{rhel} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====


When you have created the custom channels and synchronized them with the repositories, you can create child channels.

.Procedure: Creating Child Channels

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels].
. Click btn:[Create Channel] and set these parameters for the entitlement certificate.
Ensure you use the correct {rhela} version:
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Name`` field, type [systemitem]``RHEL 7 x86_64``.
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Label`` field, type [systemitem]``rhel7-x86_64-extras``.
* In the [guimenu]``Parent Channel`` field, select [systemitem]``rhel7-x86_64-server``.
* In the [guimenu]``Architecture`` field, select [systemitem]``x86_64``.
* In the [guimenu]``Repository Checksum Type`` field, select [systemitem]``sha1``.
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Summary`` field, type [systemitem]``RHEL 7 x86_64 Extras``.
* In the [guimenu]``Organization Sharing`` field, select [systemitem]``Public``.
. Click btn:[Create Channel].
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, check the appropriate repository, and click btn:[Update repositories].
. OPTIONAL: Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` tab to set a recurring schedule for synchronization of this repository.
. Click btn:[Sync Now] to begin synchronization immediately.


[NOTE]
====
{rhel} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====



== Add Client Tools

When you have set up all the custom channels, you can add the client tools.

For this section, you will require an activation key.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].


ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

Your {susemgr} subscription entitles you to the tools channels for {sleses} (also known as {redhat} Expanded Support or RES).
You must use the client tools channel to create the bootstrap repository.
This procedure applies to both traditional and Salt minions.


.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels

. On the {productname} Server, add the appropriate {slesesa} channels:
+
* For {slesesa} 6:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``RHEL6 Base x86_64`` and [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Client Tools RES6 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-6`` and [systemitem]``res6-suse-manager-tools-x86_64``.
+
* For {slesesa} 7:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``RHEL7 Base x86_64`` and [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Client Tools RES7 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-7`` and [systemitem]``res7-suse-manager-tools-x86_64``.
.  Synchronize the {productname} Server with the {SCC}.
You can do this using the {webui}, or by running [command]``mgr-sync`` at the command prompt.
. Add the new channel to your activation key.

endif::[]


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

// spacewalk-common-channels can't be used because centosX-uyuni-client requires centos7 channel as well, which a RHEL user would not need.

.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Repositories].
. Click btn:[Create Repository] and set these parameters for the entitlement certificate:
* In the [guimenu]``Repository Label`` field, type [systemitem]``centos7-uyuni-client``.
* In the [guimenu]``Repository URL`` field, type the URL of the repository to mirror.
For example, [systemitem]``https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable:/CentOS7-Uyuni-Client-Tools/CentOS_7/``.
* In the [guimenu]``Has Signed Metadata?`` field, uncheck all Red Hat Enterprise Repositories.
* Leave all other fields as the default values.
. Click btn:[Create Repository].
. Navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels].
. Click btn:[Create Channel] and set these parameters.
Ensure you use the correct {rhela} version:
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Name`` field, type [systemitem]``Uyuni Client Tools for CentOS 7 (x86_64)``.
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Label`` field, type [systemitem]``centos7-uyuni-client-x86_64``.
* In the [guimenu]``Parent Channel`` field, select [systemitem]``rhel7-x86_64-server``.
* In the [guimenu]``Architecture`` field, select [systemitem]``x86_64``.
* In the [guimenu]``Repository Checksum Type`` field, select [systemitem]``sha1``.
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Summary`` field, type [systemitem]``Uyuni Client Tools for CentOS 7 (x86_64)``.
* In the [guimenu]``Organization Sharing`` field, select [systemitem]``Public``.
. Click btn:[Create Channel].
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, check the [systemitem]``centos7-uyuni-client`` repository, and click btn:[Update repositories].
. OPTIONAL: Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` tab to set a recurring schedule for synchronization of this repository.
. Click btn:[Sync Now] to begin synchronization immediately.
. Add the new channel to your activation key.

endif::[]

You can choose to disable the {rhel} subscription-manager yum plugins.
// Explain the use case.

The yum plugins are disabled with a configuration Salt state.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is optional.
====



.Procedure: Creating a Salt State to Deploy Configuration Files

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels].
. Click btn:[Create State Channel]
* In the [guimenu]``Name`` field, type [systemitem]``subscription-manager: disable yum plugins``.
* In the [guimenu]``Label`` field, type [systemitem]``subscription-manager-disable-yum-plugins``.
* In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, type [systemitem]``subscription-manager: disable yum plugins``.
* In the [guimenu]``SLS Contents`` field, leave it empty.
. Click btn:[Create Config Channel]
. Click btn:[Create Configuration File]
* In the [guimenu]``Filename/Path`` field type [systemitem]``/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf``.
* In the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field type:
----
[main]
enabled=0
----
. Click btn:[Create Configuration File]
. Take note of the value of the field [guimenu]``Salt Filesystem Path```.
. Click on the name of the Configuration Channel.
. Click on [guimenu]``View/Edit 'init.sls' File``
* In the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field, type:
----
configure_subscription-manager-disable-yum-plugins:
  cmd.run:
    - name: subscription-manager config --rhsm.auto_enable_yum_plugins=0
    - watch:
      - file: /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf
    - source: salt:///etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf
----
. Click btn:[Update Configuration File]



.Procedure: Creating a System Group for {rhel} Clients

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups].
. Click btn:[Create Group]
* In the [guimenu]``Name`` field, type [systemitem]``rhel-systems``.
* In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, type [systemitem]``All RHEL systems``.
. Click btn:[Create Group]
. Click [guimenu]``States`` tab
. Click [guimenu]``Configuration Channels`` tab
. Type [systemitem]``subscription-manager: disable yum plugins`` at the search box.
. Click btn:[Search] and the state will appear.
. Click the checkbox for the state at the [systemitem]``Assign`` column.
. Click btn:[Save changes]
. Click btn:[Confirm]

If you already have RHEL systems added to ${productname}, assign them to the new system group, and then apply the highstate.



.Procedure: Adding the System Group to Activation Keys

You need to modify the activation keys you used for RHEL systems to include the system group created above.

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. For each the Activation Keys you used for RHEL systems, click on it and:
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Groups`` tab, and theb [guimenu]``Join`` subtab.
. Check [systemitem]``Select rhel-systems```
. Click btn:[Join Selected Groups]



== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
By default, {rhel} does not trust the GPG key for {productname} {slesesa} client tools.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
By default, {rhel} does not trust the GPG key for {productname} {centos} client tools.
endif::[]

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.

However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

If this occurs, add this key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all {rhel} bootstrap scripts:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
----
sle12-gpg-pubkey-39db7c82.key
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----
endif::[]

You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.

If you are boostrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a salt state to trust the key.
Create the salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.



== Register Clients

To register your {redhat} clients, you will need a bootstrap repository.
Create the bootstrap repository at the command prompt, with this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
