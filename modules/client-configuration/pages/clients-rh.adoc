= Registering {rhel} Clients


This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {rhel} operating systems.



== Set up a {rhel} Client

Ensure that your client meets these requirements before you start:

* 8{nbsp}GB RAM or more
* Two or more physical or virtual CPU cores
* Access to {rhel} installation and subscription media
* An LVM or an NFS mount is recommended

You will need to ensure you provision enough disk space.
The [path]``/var/spacewalk`` directory contains all mirrored RPMs,  and can take a significant amount of disk space.
For example, the {rhel}{nbsp}6 x86_64 channels require over 90{nbsp}GB.

Taskomatic will use one CPU core, and requires at least 3072{nbsp}MB RAM.
To ensure that Taskomatic has access to enough memory, open the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, and add this line:

----
taskomatic.java.maxmemory=3072
----

[WARNING]
====
You are responsible for arranging access to Red Hat base media repositories and RHEL installation media.
You must obtain support from either Red Hat or {suse} for all your RHEL systems.
If you do not do this, you might be violating your terms with Red Hat.
====



== {rhel} Channel Management

The base {rhel} software channel does not contain any packages.
This is because {suse} does not provide {rhel} base media.
You will need to obtain base media from Red Hat, which you can then add as a child channel to the {rhel} parent channel.

The {rhel} and tools channels are provided by {scc}.
You can synchronize your client with the [command]``mgr-sync`` command to get them.

Because the {rhel} channels are particularly large, it can take up to 24Â hours for an initial channel synchronization to complete.
When you have completed the initial synchronization, we recommended you clone the channel before working with it.
This provides you with a backup of the original synchronization data.

The following procedure guides you through setup of the {rhel} media as a {productname} channel.
All packages on the media will be mirrored into a child channel located under the distribution name and architecture.

.Procedure: Setting up a {rhel} Channel
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Channels[Manage Software Channels], and click btn:[Create Channel].
. Fill in the channel details, and add the channel as a child to the corresponding {rhel} distribution channel for your architecture.
The base parent channel will not contain any packages.
. Modify the associated activation key to include your new child channel.
. At the command prompt, as root, copy your installation disk image to the [path]``/tmp`` directory.
. Create a directory to contain the media content:
+
----
mkdir -p /srv/www/htdocs/pub/rhel
----
. Mount the ISO:
+
----
mount -o loop /tmp/name_of_iso /srv/www/htdocs/pub/rhel
----
. Synchronize the packages with [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync``:
+
For {rhel} 7:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/
Repo URL: https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/
Packages in repo:              [...]
Packages already synced:       [...]
Packages to sync:              [...]
[...]
----
+
For {rhel} 6:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/Server/
Repo URL: https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/Server/
Packages in repo:              [...]
Packages already synced:       [...]
Packages to sync:              [...]
[...]
----

Sometimes, the [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` will stop running during a synchronization, which will give this error:
----
[Errno 256] No more mirrors to try.
----

If this occurs, you can run [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` in debugging mode to determine the error.

Start debugging mode:
----
export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG
----

Check the output:
----
/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel _<channel-label>_ --type yum
----

Disable debug mode:
----
unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG``
----



== Register {rhel} Clients


Before you register {rhel} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the corresponding {rhel} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

You will also need an activation key associated with the {rhel} channel.
For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Missing packages will cause your registration to fail.
For {rhel} clients, packages are contained on the {rhel} installation media.
Ensure you have loop-mounted the installation media, and added it as a child channel to the base {rhel} channel.
====


{rhel} 7::
* Product: {rhel} 7
* Mandatory channels: [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-7`` , [systemitem]``res7-suse-manager-tools-x86_64`` , [systemitem]``res7-x86_64``


{rhel} 6::
* Product: {rhel} 6
* Mandatory channels: [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-6`` , [systemitem]``res6-suse-manager-tools-x86_64`` , [systemitem]``res6-x86_64``


There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

* In the {productname}{webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the menu:SUSE Products[] tab.
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
* You can also check the synchronization log file at the command prompt.
Use the [command]``cat`` or [command]``tail -f`` command to view the [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync/channel-label.log`` file.
If you use this method, remember that base channels can contain multiple child channels.
Each of the child channels will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.

When you are ready to register your {rhel} client, follow the instructions in xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].

.Procedure: Registering a bootstrap repository:

 . At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, create a bootstrap repository for {rhel}:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo RHEL_activation_channel_key
----
+
If you use a dedicated channel per RHEL version, specify it with the [literal]``--with-custom-channel`` option.

. Rename [command]``bootstrap.sh`` to [command]``resversion-boostrap.sh``:
+

----
cp bootstrap.sh res7-bootstrap.sh
----


== Register a Salt Client via Bootstrap


The following procedure will guide you through registering a Salt client using the bootstrap script.

.Procedure: Registration Using the Bootstrap Script
. For your new client download the bootstrap script from the {productname} server:
+

----
wget --no-check-certificate https://`server`/pub/bootstrap/res7-bootstrap.sh
----
. Add the appropriate res-gpg-pubkey-#####-#####.key to the `ORG_GPG_KEY` key parameter, comma delimited in your [command]``res7-bootstrap.sh`` script. These are located on your {productname} server at:
+

----
http://`server`/pub/
----
. Make the [command]``res7-bootstrap.sh`` script executable and run it. This will install necessary Salt packages from the bootstrap repository and start the Salt client service:
+

----
chmod +x res7-bootstrap.sh
./res7-boostrap.sh
----

. From the {productname} {webui} select menu:Salt[Keys] and accept the new client's key.

I'm fairly certain this isn't supported, which is why we took it out of the SLE instructions. LKB 2018-08-12

== Manual Salt Client Registration


The following procedure will guide you through the registration of a Salt client manually.


. Add the bootstrap repository:
+

----
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://`server`/pub/repositories/res/7/bootstrap
----
. Install the [package]#salt-minion# package:
+

----
yum install salt-minion
----
. Edit the Salt client configuration file to point to the {productname} server:
+

----
mkdir /etc/salt/minion.d
echo "master:`server_fqdn`" > /etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf
----
. Start the client service:
+

----
systemctl start salt-minion
----

. From the {productname} {webui} select the menu:Salt[Keys] and accept the new client's key.
