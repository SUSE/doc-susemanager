= Registering {rhel} Clients


This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {rhel} operating systems.



== Server requirements

[WARNING]
====
You are responsible for arranging access to Red Hat base media repositories and RHEL installation media.
You must obtain support from either Red Hat or {suse} for all your RHEL systems.
If you do not do this, you might be violating your terms with Red Hat.
====

Ensure that your {productname} Server meets the requirements outlined at xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

Taskomatic will use one CPU core, and requires at least 3072{nbsp}MB RAM.

To ensure that Taskomatic has access to enough memory, open the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, add this line:

----
taskomatic.java.maxmemory=3072
----

Restart Taskomatic:
----
systemctl restart taskomatic

== {rhel} Channel Management

=== Add {rhel} product from SCC

Before you register {rhel} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the corresponding {rhel} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

You will also need an activation key associated with the {rhel} channel.
For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].

{rhel} 7::
* Product: {rhel} 7
* Mandatory channels: [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-7`` , [systemitem]``res7-suse-manager-tools-x86_64`` , [systemitem]``res7-x86_64``


{rhel} 6::
* Product: {rhel} 6
* Mandatory channels: [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-6`` , [systemitem]``res6-suse-manager-tools-x86_64`` , [systemitem]``res6-x86_64``


There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the menu:SUSE Products[] tab.
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
* You can also check the synchronization log file at the command prompt.
Use the [command]``cat`` or [command]``tail -f`` command to view the [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync/channel-label.log`` file.
If you use this method, remember that base channels can contain multiple child channels.
Each of the child channels will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Missing packages will cause your registration to fail.
For {rhel} clients, packages are contained on the {rhel} installation media.
Ensure you have loop-mounted the installation media, and added it as a child channel to the base {rhel} channel.
====

=== Add {rhel} media

The base {rhel} software channel does not contain any packages.
This is because {suse} does not provide {rhel} base media.
You will need to obtain base media from Red Hat, which you can then add as a child channel to the {rhel} parent channel.

The {rhel} and tools channels are provided by {scc}.
You can synchronize your client with the [command]``mgr-sync`` command to get them.

Because the {rhel} channels are particularly large, it can take up to 24Â hours for an initial channel synchronization to complete.
When you have completed the initial synchronization, we recommended you clone the channel before working with it.
This provides you with a backup of the original synchronization data.

The following procedure guides you through setup of the {rhel} media as a {productname} channel.
All packages on the media will be mirrored into a child channel located under the distribution name and architecture.

.Procedure: Setting up a {rhel} Channel
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Channels[Manage Software Channels], and click btn:[Create Channel].
. Fill in the channel details, and add the channel as a child to the corresponding {rhel} distribution channel for your architecture.
The base parent channel will not contain any packages.
. Modify the associated activation key to include your new child channel.
. At the command prompt, as root, copy your installation disk image to the [path]``/tmp`` directory.
. Create a directory to contain the media content:
+
----
mkdir -p /srv/www/htdocs/pub/rhel
----
. Mount the ISO:
+
----
mount -o loop /tmp/name_of_iso /srv/www/htdocs/pub/rhel
----
. Synchronize the packages with [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync``:
+
For {rhel} 7:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/
Repo URL: https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/
Packages in repo:              [...]
Packages already synced:       [...]
Packages to sync:              [...]
[...]
----
+
For {rhel} 6:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/Server/
Repo URL: https://127.0.0.1/pub/rhel/Server/
Packages in repo:              [...]
Packages already synced:       [...]
Packages to sync:              [...]
[...]
----

Sometimes, the [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` will stop running during a synchronization, which will give this error:
----
[Errno 256] No more mirrors to try.
----

If this occurs, you can run [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` in debugging mode to determine the error.

Start debugging mode:
----
export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG
----

Check the output:
----
/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channel-label> --type yum
----

Disable debug mode:
----
unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG
----

== Register {rhel} Clients

When you are ready to register your {rhel} client, follow the instructions in xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
