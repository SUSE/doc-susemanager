= Contact Methods

There are a number of ways that the {productname} Server can communicate with traditional and Salt clients.
Which one you use depends on your network architecture.


== {productname} Daemon (rhnsd)


The {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``) runs on traditional client systems and periodically connects with {productname} to check for new updates and notifications.
It does not apply to Salt clients.

It is only used on {sle}{nbsp}11 and {rhnminrelease6}, as these systems do not use systemd.
On later operating systems, a systemd timer ([systemitem]``rhnsd.timer``) is used and controlled by [systemitem]``rhnsd.service``.

Start the daemon with [command]``/etc/init.d/rhnsd``.

By default, it will check every four hours for new actions.
This means it can take some time for clients to execute scheduled actions.

To check for updates, [systemitem]``rhnsd`` runs the external [systemitem]``mgr_check`` program located in [path]``/usr/sbin/``.
This is a small application that establishes the network connection to {productname}.
The SUSE Manager daemon does not listen on any network ports or talk to the network directly.
All network activity is performed by the [systemitem]``mgr_check`` utility.

This figure provides an overview of the default [systemitem]``rhnsd`` process path.
All items left of the [systemitem]``Python XMLRPC server`` block represent processes running on a {productname} client.

=== Configure rhnsd

The `rhnsd` initialization script has a configuration file on the client system at [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnsd``.

An important parameter for the daemon is its check-in frequency.
The default interval time is four hours (240 minutes).
The minimum allowed time interval is one hour (60 minutes).
If you set the interval below one hour, it will change back to the default of 4 hours (240 minutes).

If you modify the `rhnsd` configuration file, execute this command as root to restart the daemon and pick up your changes:
----
/etc/init.d/rhnsd restart
----

To see the status of `rhnsd`, use this command as root:
----
/etc/init.d/rhnsd status
----

On {sle}{nbsp}12 and later, the default time interval is set in [path]``/etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants/rhnsd.timer``, in this section:

----
[Timer]
OnCalendar=00/4:00
RandomizedDelaySec=30min
----

You can create an overriding drop-in file for [path]``rhnsd.timer`` using [command]``systemctl``:

----
systemctl edit rhnsd.timer
----

For example, if you want configure a two hour time interval:

----
[Timer]
OnCalendar=00/2:00
----

The file will be saved as [path]``/etc/systemd/system/rhnsd.timer.d/override.conf``.

For more information about system timers, see the [command]``systemd.timer`` and [command]``systemctl`` manpages.



== Push via SSH


Push via SSH is used in environments where traditional clients cannot reach the {productname} Server directly.
In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the {productname} Server.

The Push via SSH method creates an encrypted tunnel from the {productname} Server on the internal network to the clients located on the DMZ.
After all actions and events are executed, the tunnel is closed.

The server uses SSH to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events.

This contact method works for traditional clients only.
For Salt clients, use Push via Salt SSH.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Re-installing systems using the provisioning model is not currently supported on clients managed with push via SSH.
====


This image demonstrates the push via SSH process path.
All items left of the [systemitem]``Taskomatic`` block represent processes running on a {productname} client.

image::sshpush-taigon.png[scaledwidth=80%]


For tunneling connections via SSH, two available port numbers are required, one for tunneling HTTP and the second for tunneling via HTTPS (HTTP is only necessary during the registration process).
The port numbers used by default are `1232` and `1233`.
To overwrite these, you can add two custom port numbers greater than 1024 to [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
ssh_push_port_http = high_port_1
ssh_push_port_https = high_port_2
----


If you would like your clients to be contacted using their hostnames instead of an IP address, set this option:

----
ssh_push_use_hostname = true
----


It is also possible to adjust the number of threads to use for opening client connections in parallel.
By default two parallel threads are used.
Set [systemitem]``taskomatic.ssh_push_workers`` in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
taskomatic.ssh_push_workers = number
----


For security reasons, you might want to use sudo with SSH, to access the system as an unprivileged user instead of as root.


.Procedure: Configuring Unprivileged SSH Access
. Ensure you have the latest [path]``spacewalk-taskomatic`` and [path]``spacewalk-certs-tools`` packages installed on the {productname} Server.
. On each client system, create an appropriate unprivileged user on each client system.
. On each client system, open the [path]``/etc/sudoers`` file and comment out these lines:
+
----
#Defaults targetpw   # ask for the password of the target user i.e. root
#ALL    ALL=(ALL) ALL   # WARNING! Only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'!
----
. On each client system, in the `User privilege specification` section, add these lines:
+
----
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/mgr_check
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/home/<user>/enable.sh
<user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/home/<user>/bootstrap.sh
----
. On each client system, in the [path]``/home/user/.bashrc`` file, add these lines:
+
----
PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin
export PATH
----
. On the {productname} Server, in the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, add or amend this line to include the unprivileged username:
+
----
ssh_push_sudo_user = <user>
----


Because clients are in the DMZ and cannot reach the server, you need to use the [command]``mgr-ssh-push-init`` tool to register them with the {productname} Server.

To use the tool, you will need the client hostname or IP address, and the path to a valid bootstrap script on the {productname} Server.
For more information about bootstrapping, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

The bootstrap script will need to have an activation key associated with it that is configured for Push via SSH.
For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].

Before you begin, you need to ensure that you have specified which ports to use for SSH tunneling.
If you have registered clients before changing the port numbers, they will need to be registered again.

[NOTE]
====
Clients that are managed with Push via SSH cannot reach the server directly.
When you use the [command]``mgr-ssh-push-init`` tool, the [systemitem]``rhnsd`` daemon is disabled.
====


.Procedure: Registering Clients with Push via SSH
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, execute this command:
+
----
# mgr-ssh-push-init --client <client> --register \
/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_script --tunnel
----
+
OPTIONAL: You can remove the [command]``--tunnel`` option, if you do not want to use tunneling.
. Verify that the SSH connection is active:
+
----
# ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_susemanager -R <high_port>:<susemanager>:443 \
<client> zypper ref
----



.Example: API Access to Push via SSH

You can use the API to manage which contact method to use.
This example Python code sets the contact method to ``ssh-push``.

Valid values are:

* `default` (pull)
* `ssh-push`
* `ssh-push-tunnel`

----
client = xmlrpclib.Server(SUMA_HOST + "/rpc/api", verbose=0)
key = client.auth.login(SUMA_LOGIN, SUMA_PASSWORD)
client.system.setDetails(key, 1000012345, {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'})
----



If you have a client that has already been registered, and you want to migrate it to use Push via SSH, some extra steps are required.
You can use the [command]``mgr-ssh-push-init`` tool to set up your client.


.Procedure: Migrating Registered Systems to Push via SSH
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, set up the client:
+
----
# mgr-ssh-push-init --client <client> \
/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_script --tunnel
----
. Using the {productname} {webui}, change the client's contact method to `ssh-push` or `ssh-push-tunnel`.
. OPTIONAL: If you need to edit an existing activation key, you can do so with this command:
+
----
client.activationkey.setDetails(key, '1-mykey', {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'})
----



You can also use Push via SSH for clients that connect using a {productname} Proxy.
Ensure your proxy is updated before you begin.

.Procedure: Registering Clients with Push via SSH to a Proxy
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Proxy, as root, set up the client:
+
----
# mgr-ssh-push-init --client <client> \
/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_script --tunnel
----
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, copy the SSH key to the proxy:
+
----
mgr-ssh-push-init --client <proxy>
----



== Push via Salt SSH


Push via Salt SSH is used in environments where Salt clients cannot reach the {productname} Server directly.
In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the {productname} Server.

The Push via Salt SSH method creates an encrypted tunnel from the {productname} Server on the internal network to the clients located on the DMZ.
After all actions and events are executed, the tunnel is closed.

The server uses the [command]``salt-ssh`` tool to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events.
For more information about Salt SSH, see xref:salt:salt-ssh.adoc[].

This contact method works for Salt clients only.
For traditional clients, use Push via SSH.

This image demonstrates the Push via Salt SSH process path.
All items left of the [systemitem]``Taskomatic`` block represent processes running on a {productname} client.

image::salt-ssh-contact-taigon.png[scaledwidth=80%]


To use Push via Salt SSH, you must have the SSH daemon running on the client, and reachable by the [systemitem]``salt-api`` daemon running on the {productname} Server.
Additionally, Python must be available on the remote system, and be a version supported by Salt.

[NOTE]
====
{rhel}{nbsp}5, {centos}{nbsp}5, and earlier are not supported, as they use unsupported versions of Python.
====


.Procedure: Registering Clients with Push via Salt SSH
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping] and complete the appropriate fields.
. Select an activation key with the Push via SSH contact method configured.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].
. Check the [systemitem]``Manage system completely via SSH`` checkbox.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap] to begin registration.
. Confirm that the system has been registered correctly by navigating to menu:Systems[Overview].


When you are configuring Push via Salt SSH, you can modify parameters that are used when a system is registered, including the host, activation key, and password.
The password is used only for bootstrapping, it is not saved anywhere.
All future SSH sessions are authorized via a key/certificate pair.
These parameters are configured in menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].

You can also configure persistent parameters that are are used system-wide, including the sudo user.
For more information on configuring the sudo user, see the Push via SSH section in this chapter.


The Push via Salt SSH feature uses taskomatic to execute scheduled actions using [command]``salt-ssh``.
The taskomatic job periodically checks for scheduled actions and executes them.
Unlike Push via SSH on traditional clients, the Push via Salt SSH feature executes a complete [command]``salt-ssh`` call based on the scheduled action.

There are some features that are not yet supported on Push via Salt SSH.
These features will not work on Salt SSH clients:

* OpenSCAP auditing
* Beacons, resulting in:
** Installing a package on a system using [command]``zypper`` will not invoke the package refresh.
** Virtual Host functions (for example, a host to guests) will not work if the virtual host system is Salt SSH-based.


For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/.



== OSAD


OSAD is an alternative contact method between {productname} and its clients.
By default, {productname} uses [systemitem]``rhnsd``, which contacts the server every four hours to execute scheduled actions.
OSAD allows registered client systems to execute scheduled actions immediately.

[NOTE]
====
Use OSAD in addition to [systemitem]``rhnsd``.
If you disable [systemitem]``rhnsd`` your client will be shown as not checking in after 24 hours.
====

OSAD has several distinct components:

* The [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` service runs on the server, and uses database checks  to determine if clients need to be pinged, or if actions need to be executed.
* The [systemitem]``osad`` service runs on the client. It responds to pings from [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` and runs [command]``mgr_check`` to execute actions when directed to do so.
* The [systemitem]``jabberd`` service is a daemon that uses the [systemitem]``XMPP`` protocol for communication between the client and the server.
The [systemitem]``jabberd`` service also handles authentication.
* The [command]``mgr_check`` tool runs on the client to execute actions.
It is triggered by communication from the [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` service.

The [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` periodically runs a query to check when clients last showed network activity.
If it finds a client that has not shown activity recently, it will use [systemitem]``jabberd`` to ping all [systemitem]``osad`` instances running on all clients registered with your {productname} server.
The [systemitem]``osad`` instances respond to the ping using [systemitem]``jabberd``, which is running in the background on the server.
When the [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` receives the response, it marks the client as online.
If the [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` fails to receive a response within a certain period of time, it marks the client as offline.

When you schedule actions on an OSAD-enabled system, the task will be carried out  immediately.
The [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` periodically checks clients for actions that need to be executed.
If an outstanding action is found, it uses [systemitem]``jabberd`` to execute [command]``mgr_check`` on the client, which will then execute the action.


OSAD clients use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server to communicate with the [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` service.

SSL is required for [systemitem]``osad`` communication.
If SSL certificates are not available, the daemon on your client systems will fail to connect.
Make sure your firewall rules are set to allow the required ports.
For more information, see <<tab.install.ports.server>>.


.Procedure: Enabling OSAD
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, start the [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` service:
+
----
systemctl start osa-dispatcher
----
. On each client, install the [systemitem]``mgr-osad`` package from the [systemitem]``Tools`` child channel.
The [systemitem]``mgr-osad`` package should be installed on clients only.
If you install the [systemitem]``mgr-osad`` package on your {productname} Server, it will conflict with the [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` package.
. On each client, as root, start the [systemitem]``osad`` service:
+
----
systemctl start osad
----
+
Because [systemitem]``osad`` and [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher`` are run as services, you can use standard commands to manage them, including [command]``stop``, [command]``restart``, and [command]``status``.


Each OSAD component is configured using local configuration files.
We recommend you keep the default configuration parameters for all OSAD components.


[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Component                        | Location | Path to Configuration File
| [systemitem]``osa-dispatcher``   | Server   | [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` Section: [systemitem]``OSA configuration``
| [systemitem]``osad``             | Client   | [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/osad.conf``
| [systemitem]``osad`` log file    | Client   | [path]``/var/log/osad``
| [systemitem]``jabberd`` log file | Both     | [path]``/var/log/messages``
|===


.Troubleshooting OSAD

If your OSAD clients cannot connect to the server, or if the [systemitem]``jabberd`` service takes a lot of time responding to port 5552, it could be because you have exceeded the open file count.

Every client needs one always-open TCP connection to the server, which consumes a single file handler.
If the number of file handlers currently open exceeds the maximum number of files that [systemitem]``jabberd`` is allowed to use, [systemitem]``jabberd`` will queue the requests, and refuse connections.

To resolve this issue, you can increase the file limits for [systemitem]``jabberd`` by editing the [path]``/etc/security/limits.conf`` configuration file and adding these lines:

----
jabbersoftnofile5100
jabberhardnofile6000
----

Calculate the limits required for your environment by adding 100 to the number of clients for the soft limit, and 1000 to the current number of clients for the soft limit.
In the example above, we have assumed 500 current clients, so the soft limit is 5100, and the hard limit is 6000.

You will also need to update the [systemitem]``max_fds`` parameter in the [path]``/etc/jabberd/c2s.xml`` file with your chosen hard limit:

----
<max_fds>6000</max_fds>
----
