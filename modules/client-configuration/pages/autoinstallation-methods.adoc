= Automate Client Installation
// was: Introduction


Kickstart and {ay} configuration files allow you to automate client installations.
This is especially useful if you need to install a large number of clients.

For {sle} clients, use {ay}.
When you have created an {ay} file, you can upload it and manage it with {productname}.

For {rhel} clients, use {kickstart}.
{kickstart} files are created, modified, and managed within the {productname} {webui}.

The Cobbler installation server allows you to automate bare-metal installations.
It uses DHCP to access a PXE boot server, and can be used in virtualized environments.

It is also possible to perform a disconnected setup, in an environment where you cannot access the internet.
