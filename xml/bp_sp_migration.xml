 <title>&susemgr; Server Migration</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    You can upgrade the underlying operating system and also migrate &susemgr;
    server from one patch level to the other (SP migration) or from one version
    to the next. This works for migrating &susemgr; server 3.0 to
    version 3.1.
   </para>

   <para>
    For migrating from version 2.1 to 3.0, see
    <xref linkend="bp.chap.mgr.migration"/>.

  <title>Service Pack Migration</title>

  <para>
   SUSE Manager utilizes &sls; 12 as its underlying operating system.
   Therefore Service Pack migration (for example, from version 12 SP1 to
   12 SP3) may be performed in the same way as a typical SLES migration.
  </para>

  <warning>
   <title>Upgrading PostgreSQL to Version 9.6 before Migrating to SLES
   12 SP3</title>
   <para>
    Before migrating the underlying system to &sle; 12 SP3 you must
    upgrade PostgreSQL to version 9.6.
   </para>
   <para>
    The migration needs PostgreSQL 9.4 and 9.6 installed in parallel and
    PostgreSQL 9.4 is only available in SLES 12 SP2.  For more
    information, see <xref linkend="sp.migration.postgresql"/>.
   </para>
  </warning>
  
  <para>
   &suse; offers a graphical and command line tool for upgrading to a new
   service pack. Comprehensive documentation for executing service pack
   migration scenarios is located in the &sls; documentation chapter

  <title>Upgrading PostgreSQL to Version 9.6</title>

   <title>Migrating to SLES 12 SP3</title>
   <para>
    &susemgr; Server 3.1 must <emphasis>not</emphasis> be migrated to SLES 12 SP3 before upgrading PostgreSQL to version 9.6.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <para>
   The upgrade needs PostgreSQL 9.4 and 9.6 installed in parallel.
   PostgreSQL 9.4 is only available in SLES 12 SP2.
  </para>
  <para>
   Before starting the update, prepare an up-to-date backup of your
   database.

  <para>
   On existing installations of &susemgr; Server 3.1 you must run
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.root;/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate.sh</screen>
  <para>
   to migrate from PostgreSQL 9.4 to version 9.6.  During the upgrade
   your &susemgr; Server will not be accessible.
  </para>
  <para>
   The upgrade will create a copy of the database under
   <filename>/var/lib/pgsql</filename> and thus needs sufficient disk
   space to hold two copies (9.4 and 9.6) of the database.  Because it
   does a full copy of the database, it also needs considerable time
   depending on the size of the database and the IO speed of the storage
   system.
  </para>
  <para>
   If your system is short on disk space you can do an fast, in-place
   upgrade by running
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt.root;/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate.sh fast</screen>
  <para>
   The fast upgrade usually only takes minutes and no additional disk
   space. However, in case of failure you need to restore the database
   from a backup.
