 <title>&susemgr; Server Migration</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    You can upgrade the underlying operating system and also migrate
    &susemgr; server from one patch level to the other (SP migration) or
    from one version to the next.  This works for migrating &susemgr;
    server 3.0 to version 3.1.
   </para>
   <para>
    For migrating from version 2.1 to 3.0, see <xref

  <title>Service Pack Migration</title>
  <para>
   SUSE Manager utilizes &sls; 12 as its underlying operating system.
   Therefore Service Pack migration (for example, from version 12 SP1 to
   12 SP2) may be performed in the same way as a typical SLES migration.
  </para>
  <para>
   &suse; offers a graphical and command line tool for upgrading to a
   new service pack.  Comprehensive documentation for executing service
   pack migration scenarios is located in the &sls; documentation chapter

   The migration can either be done with the Online Migration tool
   (&yast;) or with the Zypper command line tool.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Reduce Installation Size</title>
   <para>
    When performing the migration, &yast; will install all recommended
    packages. Especially in the case of custom minimal installations,
    this may increase the installation size of the system significantly.
   </para>
   <para>
    To change this default behavior and allow only required packages, adjust
    <filename>/etc/zypp/zypp.conf</filename> and set the following variable:
   </para>
<screen>solver.onlyRequires = true
installRecommends=false # or commented</screen>
   <para>
    This changes the behavior of all package operations, such as the
    installation of patches or new packages.
