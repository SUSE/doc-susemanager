         <title>Base system upgrade to &sles; 11 SP3</title>
         <para>
          The underlying &sles; 11 base system has been upgraded to
          Service Pack 3 (including updates).

        <title>Upgrade to upstream Spacewalk 2.1</title>
        <para>
         The &susemgr; code has been updated to reflect the 2.1
         release of the upstream Spacewalk project (including
         updates).

        <title>Non compliant systems</title>
        <para>
         The semantics of non-compliant systems have changed. A system
         is considered non-compliant if it has packages installed
         which are not available in a channel. A non-compliant system
         cannot be reinstalled. The old semantics looked for packages
         in all available channels.  The new semantics look for
         packages only in channels assigned to the system.

        <title>Channel synchronisation logging</title>
        <para>
         Logging of channel synchronisation, triggered by
         <command>mgr-ncc-sync</command>, was done per channel and
         sync run. Every new sync created a new log file. A cron job
         was used to clean up older logs files. With &susemgr; 2.1
         there is only one log file per channel. All synchronisation
         runs for a specific channel log to the same file. Older log
         files are rotated and compressed now, using logrotate.

        <title>Inter-Server Sync between 1.7 (master) and 2.1 (slave)</title>
        <para>
         An inter-server synchronization (ISS) between a &susemgr; 1.7
         Server as master and a &susemgr; 2.1 Server as client will
         succeed but generate an error mail to the administrator. The
         error email is harmless and can be deleted.

        <para>
         When upgrading a &susemgr; Server with Database 1.7 (using
         embedded Oracle DB), an additional permission (create role)
         will be added.

         Stored procedures in PostgreSQL can now be written in the TCL
         language. The package <systemitem>pgtcl</systemitem> will be
         added on upgrade.

        <para>
         The status of a rebooted client is now updated
         immediately. In the past, there was a delay in the status
         update.
