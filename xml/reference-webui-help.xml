    RHN Proxy Server is a package-caching mechanism that reduces the
    bandwidth requirements for RHN and &susemgr; servers and enables custom
    package deployment. Proxy customers cache RPMs, such as Errata Updates
    from Red Hat or custom RPMs generated by their organization, on an
    internal, centrally-located server. Client systems then receive these
    updates from the Proxy rather than by accessing the Internet
    individually.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <citetitle>RHN Proxy Server Installation Guide</citetitle> provides
    detailed information regarding RHN Proxy server installation and initial
    configuration.

    An Red Hat Network and RHN &susemgr; software channel is a collection of
    software packages. Channels help you segregate packages by sensible
    rules: That is, a channel may contain packages from a specific Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux version, for instance. A channel may contain packages
    for an application or family of applications. Users may also define
    channels for their own particular needs; a company may create a channel
    that contains packages for all of the organization's laptops, for
    example.

   Implementing a fully functional &susemgr; requires more than
   installing software and a database. Client systems must be configured to
   use &susemgr;. Custom packages and channels should be created for
   optimal use. Since these tasks extend beyond the basic installation, they
