   <title>Version Information</title>
   <para>
    &susemgr; 3.1 was originally released as a
    SLES 12 SP2 extension.  With the next maintenance update (December 2018),
    &susemgr; 3.1 will be based on SLES 12 SP4 and support SLE 12 SP4 clients
    officially.  In the following sections and chapters, it is highly
    recommended to use SLE 12 SP4 instead of SP2 or SP3.
